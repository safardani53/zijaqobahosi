After that, he immediately junior college at the </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>College of Marin</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, where he practiced football during college days.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/young-pete-carroll.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, his interest in football grew during his college days. Pete demanded a transfer from Marin. He went to </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>the University of Pacific&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>to study football.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, after that, he gave up studying for a while and started to play football.</span></p><p>Pete’s massive interest in sports shaped his football career.

Carroll hadn’t coached any team for a single year.</p><p>Though he had a lack of experience, the Trojans believed him. As a result, the Trojans finished in the first position five times during his tenure.</p><h3>Contract with Seattle Seahawks</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Pete retired from the Trojans and signed for&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Seattle Seahawks</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> in 2010. He and the Seahawks drafted a contract for five years.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, the board also appointed him as executive vice president of the club.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Carroll has bagged different trophies with Seahawks from 2010. In the first year of his career, the Seahawks finished in the first position in NFC West.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, they were defeated by </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Chicago Bears</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in NFC divisional game.</span></p><p>Until 2013, Pete suffered massive criticisms for his coaching skills. The club’s board regularly questioned him for losses against the rival teams. But in 2013, something magical happened, the Seahawks won the Super Bowl.</p><p>After the trophy, the club extended his contract, and he remains the coach of the Seahawks, till now. During his coaching, various records got broken.</p><p>The Seahawks score defense four years straight. It was the first team to do so after the 1950s <strong>Cleveland Browns</strong>.</p><h3>Coaching Style&nbsp;</h3><p>Pete Carroll has been an exclusive coach and is also known for his back-to-back Super Bowl wins. Additionally, he is best-known as a “player’s coach,” and is recognized for his unique skills and methods.</p><p>One of his widely known techniques is to have fun while being competitive. Right before the games, he blasts huge songs before the game to boost their confidence. Furthermore, he organizes a mini-basketball hoop at their training facility to test players’ focus.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, Carroll also organized a beach volleyball tournament while in the USC. Apparently, it had the sole focus of understanding the line between college parties and games.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, he emphasizes gameplay in the action of rugby asking players to use their shoulders rather than their head. Similarly, he always tries to gain new skills for the players and thus, watches YouTube videos for updates.</p><p>Moving on, he also indulges in the TV broadcast’s videos. Altogether, he is an aggressive player and often tries to understand a player’s personality. He also believes in constant interaction with his assistant coach and players for better understanding.</p><p>Overall, he has also written an autobiography regarding his ethics, philosophies, and goals.&nbsp;</p><h3>Controversial Decision</h3><p>Glancing back in Super Bowl XLIX, Pete Carroll’s decision for the game went viral for all the very negative reasons. Indeed, he faced numerous criticisms right then and there and even got the title as the worst coaching decision ever.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, it was in fact one of the most controversial decisions ever in history that even <a href=#>Emmitt Smith</a> declared it to be the worst call in the history of the sport. Back then, Carroll called for a pass after the last-moment interception instead of a hand-off.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, they did face a heartbreaking loss in the Super Bowl. As the videos and comments went viral, he was blamed and called out for his decision. Anyways, he tried for the best strategy for his team, which unfortunately didn’t prevail as expected.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“We knew we were going to throw the ball once in that sequence, somewhere, and suddenly they had a goal-line defense that we could blow up, so we did, and it just did not work out. It was a hard challenge. It was really hard on some players. And some of us will never get over it.”<br>-Pete Carroll&nbsp;</p><h2>Pete Carroll | Family – Wives, and Kids</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Pete and Wendy dated together for three years. After some time, Pete tied his knots with&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wendy Pearl&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>on June 2, 1973.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is not much information about her, though.
