It’s even bigger, want to see that?’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, Dawson has come to recognize that as mother and daughter, they are “always growing” and “always learning.” The actress explained, “For me, it’s what I would imagine as my first marriage almost. It’s a real commitment for life and it’s really powerful that she was old enough to choose me back, so it’s really, really beautiful.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When reflecting on how she and her daughter were able to meet and understand each other prior to the adoption, Dawson emphasized the importance — and common thread — of “chosen family,” who she said are often “even more pivotal sometimes than actual blood family members.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve done that Rent thing of having family that are really important to you but you met them at 10 and 20 and 30 [and] it’s the same thing,” she said. “I got to meet my daughter and she met me and it was really clear from the get. It’s remarkable. We are family. She is absolutely my kid, I am absolutely her mother.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Isabella is currently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>expecting her first child</a>.

Speaking to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Health for its March 2021 issue</a>, the actress explained that she didn’t go through an adoption agency or center. Dawson said she knew Isabella's biological mother, and after finding out that Isabella was in foster care, she sought her out. “It wasn't even a question; it was clearly meant to be," Dawson said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm grateful for her development, our maturation and our connection," she explained in her cover story for the magazine. "To have a young person move in with you and to have to really consciously work through triggers and that kind of stuff is a really different thing than being pregnant and having your baby grow up in front of you — to be able to see how we're getting closer and closer.

My mom's Isabel Celeste, I'm Rosario Isabel."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dawson said her daughter has several nicknames and previously enjoyed being called Bella, but now prefers Isa. However, for years after Dawson adopted Isabella, she was incorrectly referred to as Lola in the press and in public. Dawson set the record straight on the We Are Family podcast, explaining, “When I adopted her, I didn't put her name out. It wasn't like I did a press release or anything, and I don't know where it came from, but somebody decided that her name was Lola and then everyone just kept running with it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was like, 'I'm not correcting it because I don't need everybody to know my kid's name,' " she added.

Dawson shared that she didn't allow her then-teenage daughter to have a cell phone due to its negative effects on mental health. She said it was “critically important” for adults to monitor their kids to ensure they were not “going down dark alleys without some kind of information.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think this is a critical time for kids to be developing themselves,” she said at the event. “They can present themselves online as opposed to develop themselves online.
