The five men — Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, Kevin Richardson, Korey Wise, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raymond Santana</a> — were wrongfully convicted of brutally attacking and raping a Central Park jogger in NYC in 1989. As a result, each of the men were sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Thankfully, Matias Reyes, a serial rapist, later confessed to the crime which led the five men to be exonerated. Since then, celebrities, public figures. and social media alike have praised these men for their courage and wished them well on their lives post-prison.</p><p>Most of the men have retreated to living private lives, but Raymond has been in the public eye. From appearing on Marriage Boot Camp with his wife, reality star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deelishis</a>, to promoting his streetwear brand, the world has become Raymond’s oyster. Unfortunately, his marriage has gone south, and fans have questions about how it'll affect the rest of his public image, including his net worth.

This figure is a combination of his work as a businessman, clothing designer, reality TV star, producer, and activist. Not to mention, the Exonerated Five's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">civil lawsuits</a> against New York State for racial discrimination, malicious prosecution, and emotional distress definitely contributed to his overall wealth.
