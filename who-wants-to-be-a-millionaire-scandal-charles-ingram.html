Diana had her fine quashed on appeal.</p><p>However, after the trial the Ingrams were vilified and soon stepped out of the limelight with their three daughters, with Charles later claiming that he nearly committed suicide.</p><p>Charles retreated to his home in Westbury, <a href=#>Wiltshire</a>, selling jewellery made by Diana on a market stall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2020-lawyers-couple-say-new-577281512.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/9971b30f-9f37-4a4c-9def-c4480f5ce601.jpg><p>In October 2016, The Sun revealed he was <a href=#>flogging homemade brooches for £5 and necklaces for up to £40</a>.</p><p>The Sun tracked down the cheat and found him loading up his belongings into a van to move to a flat on a remote farm.</p><p>He decided to <a href=#>sell his £450,000 country home</a> after the scandal turned him into a recluse.</p><p>Charles was last spotted selling jewellery in a Christmas market stall in Bath in 2019, he had declared himself as <a href=#>bankrupt for the fourth time</a> just months before.</p><p>Diana also runs Bathwick Candle & Co, designing "eco-friendly, pure natural essential oil scented soy wax candles in bespoke pots", to sell online for £20 and above.</p><p>According to his <a href=#>Facebook</a>, Ingram has set up Abacus Computing Solutions and is also "director of operations" in his wife’s two businesses.</p><p>Meanwhile Tecwen resigned from his lecturer's job at Pontypridd College in <a href=#>Wales </a>shortly after the court case and reportedly had to sell his Whitchurch home to pay fines and court costs.</p><p>He apparently tried to make a living out of after-dinner speaking about his <a href=#>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</a> experiences.</p><p>After ITV show <a href=#>Quiz</a> aired on ITV, <a href=#>Charles tweeted</a> about the actor <a href=#>Matthew Macfadyen</a>, who plays him, saying: "Matthew is so damn good-looking I can’t sleep.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">You're Not Alone</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide.</p><p>It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.</p><p>It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes.</p><p>And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women.</p><p>Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.</p><p>That is why&nbsp;<a href=#>The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign.</a></p><p>The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.</p><p>Let's all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others...&nbsp;<a href=#>You're Not Alone.</a></p><p>If you, or anyone you know, needs help dealing with mental health problems, the following organisations provide support:</p><ul><li>CALM,&nbsp;<a href=#>www.thecalmzone.net</a>, 0800 585 858</li><li>Heads Together,&nbsp;<a href=#>www.headstogether.org.uk</a></li><li>Mind,&nbsp;<a href=#>www.mind.org.uk</a>, 0300 123 3393</li><li>Papyrus,<a href=#>&nbsp;www.papyrus-uk.org</a>, 0800 068 41 41</li><li>Samaritans,&nbsp;<a href=#>www.samaritans.org</a>, 116 123</li><li>Movember,&nbsp;<a href=#>www.uk.movember.com</a></li><li>Anxiety UK <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.anxietyuk.org.uk</a>, 03444 775 774 Monday-Friday 9.30am-10pm, Saturday/Sunday 10am-8pm</li></ul><p>"Trying to kid myself I looked like that 19 years ago but failing miserably.</p><p>"Diana called me ‘Matthew’ as I was brushing my teeth."</p><p>During the airing of Quiz, <a href=#>Chris Tarrant</a> was forced to come out and <a href=#>slam suggestions that the Inghams are inncocent</a>.</p><p>Writing in the&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mail</a>, he said: "I have just one slight problem with Quiz.
