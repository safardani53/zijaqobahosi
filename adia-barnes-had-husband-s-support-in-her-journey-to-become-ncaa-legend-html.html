I want to see more,” Barnes said after achieving the historic milestone. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Made to the Final Four in Her Fifth Season as a Head Coach</h2><p>Barnes, who was once a WNBA player herself, started her coaching career as an assistant coach for the University of Washington [Huskies] when the team’s head coach Kevin McGuff <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">persuaded</a> her to join the coaching staff in 2011. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>As an assistant coach at Washington, she successfully helped her team reach the Final Four in 2016.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The San Diego, California native took a big step in her coaching career when<span> she </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>signed up</span></a><span> to serve as the head coach to the women's basketba</span>ll team at the University of Arizona [Wildcats] on April 4, 2016. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, her stint as head coach didn’t start well.&nbsp;Many even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> her that it was a bad move, and she shouldn’t have taken it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But she didn’t take nonsense from anyone. Instead, she surrounded herself with a group of top athletes, led by Pac-12 player of the year Aari McDonald.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Guided by Barnes, Wildcats won the WNIT title in 2019 with a victory over Northwestern in the finals. <span>They finished the season [third] with 24 wins, the most since the 2003-04 season.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>That season was followed by another successful season for Barnes, as Arizona finished the season with a 24-7 record, tied for the second-most wins in the school's history.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But all records tumbled when Arizona made it to the Final Four of the women's NCAA tournament in her fifth season as head coach.&nbsp;</p><p>The achievement really meant a lot to her. Speaking&nbsp;with ESPN, she said, "I'm so proud, because I'm looking in their [team] eye now, and there's a fire, there's a belief, there's a confidence." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Barnes’ Husband Assisted Her to Her Success</h2><p>Yes, the saying goes, "Behind every successful man, there is a woman," but that is not always the case. On the contrary, behind this successful woman, there was a man.</p><p>When Barnes was leading the team as their&nbsp;head coach, her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">husband</a> Salvo Coppa worked&nbsp;hand-in-hand with her as the assistant coach.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The two first met in Italy and slowly turned into best friends&nbsp;and later a couple. On July 4, 2012, they <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">walked</a> down the aisle. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Presently, Barnes and Coppa are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">parents</a> to two children: a son&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;and a daughter&nbsp;Capri Adia.</p><h2>She Knew Her Father For Mere Five Months</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Born</a> on February 3, 1977, Barnes is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">daughter</a> of former NFL linebacker Peter Barnes and actress Patricia McRae. Her father, Peter, spent his 11-year playing with four different teams in NFL.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Interestingly, the women's basketball coach never got a chance to know her biological father until she received a phone call from Lee Thomas, Pete's old teammates, in 2018. He informed her that her father was living in Texas and struggling to survive.</p><p>The reason behind that was because Barnes’ parents divorced when she was only three-year-old. Following that, her mother Patricia tied knots with Bruce McRae — and Barnes happened to live with her mother and her second husband. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>As a child, she never questioned anyone about her biological father, and upon being an adult, she was more focused on her career.</p><p>However, that call from her father’s old friend met the long-separated father and daughter. After meeting her father, she realized that her father was diagnosed with dementia, and her father’s landlord had been charging him multiple times a month for expenses.</p><p>She immediately shifted her father out of that apartment, stating, “I’m sure there was paperwork, but I wasn’t going to go through anything.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Barnes further added, “I was just so upset about the situation. I bought him all new clothes it wasn’t worth taking. Everyone was taking advantage of him.”</p><p>After that, she lived with him for a brief time before shifting him to the Copper Canyon Alzheimer's Special Care Center.</p><p>All that was short-lived, as her father Peter passed away on May 3rd, 2018, in the Tucson hospice care facility, i.e., five months after Barnes met him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I didn’t think he was going to decline so fast,” Barnes said after her father passed away. She added, “I think God did this for a purpose, for me to spend the rest of his life with him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnkZm2onnBmqmnnaNitaKwjKGsrJqRo7Fuv4ysrKmon6fBbrXNZp%2Beql2fvLa%2BzZ6wZqyfYq%2Bmr86mnGamk5aubrjEoJynnF6dwa64</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fadia-barnes-had-husband-s-support-in-her-journey-to-become-ncaa-legend-html.html&text=Adia%20Barnes%20Had%20Husband%27s%20Support%20In%20Her%20Journey%20To%20Become%20NCAA%20Legend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadia-barnes-had-husband-s-support-in-her-journey-to-become-ncaa-legend-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadia-barnes-had-husband-s-support-in-her-journey-to-become-ncaa-legend-html.html&title=Adia%20Barnes%20Had%20Husband%27s%20Support%20In%20Her%20Journey%20To%20Become%20NCAA%20Legend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fadia-barnes-had-husband-s-support-in-her-journey-to-become-ncaa-legend-html.html&title=Adia%20Barnes%20Had%20Husband%27s%20Support%20In%20Her%20Journey%20To%20Become%20NCAA%20Legend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fadia-barnes-had-husband-s-support-in-her-journey-to-become-ncaa-legend-html.html&title=Adia%20Barnes%20Had%20Husband%27s%20Support%20In%20Her%20Journey%20To%20Become%20NCAA%20Legend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadia-barnes-had-husband-s-support-in-her-journey-to-become-ncaa-legend-html.html&description=Adia%20Barnes%20Had%20Husband%27s%20Support%20In%20Her%20Journey%20To%20Become%20NCAA%20Legend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tracey-hayes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Tracey Hayes net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./actor-keanu-reeves-spotted-with-a-mystery-woman-is-he-no-more-dating-his-transgender-girlfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Actor Keanu Reeves Dating Rumors with Angelina Jolie; What about his Mysterious and Transgender Girl">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
