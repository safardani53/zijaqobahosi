I talked out about his experience in an interview with Billboard after being engaged in almost two years of legal proceedings and controversy.</strong> The ascent and eventual collapse of the idol have been pretty remarkable. After making his iKON debut in 2015, the singer quickly received national and international acclaim, becoming a fan favourite for many. A drug scandal, however, altered the path of his career.</p><p>B.I was sentenced to four years probation, 80 hours of community service, 40 hours of drug education classes, and a fine of 1.5 million (roughly US$1,300) on September 10, 2021. In 2016, he was accused of three charges of unlawful marijuana use and illicit LSD purchase.</p><h2>B.I wishes to demonstrate his worth through his acts, and his one goal is to reward his followers through music.</h2><p>In an interview with Billboard, the singer discussed his journey as an idol and his journey through the most difficult moment of his life so far.&nbsp;B.I began the conversation by discussing the pressures that come with being an idol. Despite being a youngster at the time of his debut, he was saddled with a lot of duty and expectations. Being competitive did not improve matters.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/B.I-Ikon-2.jpg alt="B.I " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“Because I was so competitive as a child, I was too sensitive to outcomes. I was fascinated with the need to improve my performance, make better music, and be the greatest. I wasn’t mature enough to deal with the strain I placed on myself.”</p><p>The star admitted to making some bad judgments throughout his career, including the drug incident. B.I stated that he had succumbed to moments of weakness, which he now regrets.</p><p>“It felt like survival, like I had to win, like I had to fight. In a moment of weakness, I considered relieving that weight. Even today, I continually regret it. I shouldn’t have done it, but I felt trapped and made the wrong choice. I was very young and inexperienced.”</p><p>The drug controversy became known in June 2019, despite the fact that it occurred in 2016. The former iKON member added that he spent all of that time worried about everyone finding out, so he submerged himself in music to distract himself.&nbsp;The disappointment of his family, friends and fans was the saddest aspect of the struggle for B.I. Despite being the head of iKON, he was also forced to depart.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/B.I-Ikon-3.jpg alt="B.I " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“My thoughts had gone blank. Then I began hating myself because of the people I had failed and damaged – my family, friends, and admirers. My folks said nothing to me; they just hugged me and we sobbed together. It comforted me, but it also made the pain worse.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>This definitely screams “B.I” or “KIM HANBIN”. We cant deny the fact that he is a major reason on the success of iKON before he left. We can’t deny the fact that there’s a lot on his plate even before they debut.</p><p>BUT I’m so proud of him for still finding a way to climb up again. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/OR2KTwVpWW</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JrzOGKytxC</a></p><p>— 梦想家 🦋 (@idarariu_jikjin) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">May 20, 2022</a></p><p>B.I indicated that the magnitude of the incident had left him with a “victim mindset” that he has been attempting to overcome, conceding that no one but himself was to blame for what occurred. He went on,</p><p>“I’m attempting to influence people’s perceptions of me via my deeds, not simply my words. I’m attempting to convince everyone I meet one by one. I can’t say it’s happening right now, but I’m going to make sure it happens.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZZqFdmba0r9Ssqp6cXZavsMHTZquhnV2Zv7azjKyamqaUlrluwMeaq2abmJa7qLHDZp%2Biq12YrrOxxKtm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fb-i-discussed-about-the-drug-scandal-that-changed-his-career.html&text=B.I%20Discussed%20About%20The%20Drug%20Scandal%20That%20Changed%20His%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fb-i-discussed-about-the-drug-scandal-that-changed-his-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fb-i-discussed-about-the-drug-scandal-that-changed-his-career.html&title=B.I%20Discussed%20About%20The%20Drug%20Scandal%20That%20Changed%20His%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fb-i-discussed-about-the-drug-scandal-that-changed-his-career.html&title=B.I%20Discussed%20About%20The%20Drug%20Scandal%20That%20Changed%20His%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fb-i-discussed-about-the-drug-scandal-that-changed-his-career.html&title=B.I%20Discussed%20About%20The%20Drug%20Scandal%20That%20Changed%20His%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fb-i-discussed-about-the-drug-scandal-that-changed-his-career.html&description=B.I%20Discussed%20About%20The%20Drug%20Scandal%20That%20Changed%20His%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./david-burtka-reveals-how-to-plan-derby-de-mayo-party-entertaining-tips.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Burtka Reveals How to Plan Derby de Mayo Party, Entertaining Tips">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-ranboo-face-look-like.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ranboo and what does his face look like?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
