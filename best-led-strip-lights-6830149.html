These are also perfect for interior lighting and effects, whether you’re celebrating a fun family holiday or just want to amp up your Tuesday. They can even give you the perfect place to get a fantastic selfie — like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kylie Jenner who relied on her refrigerator lighting</a> to capture that sought-after glow. Many of our top picks can be controlled remotely.

It comes with two rolls that are each 50 feet long so you can customize your space or decor. You can sync the lights to music and they will pulse based on the volume and intensity of your jams. The included remote allows you to change the color, adjust the brightness, and choose from 25 preset modes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These aren’t cheap LED lights and may be more than you need if you just want some soft lighting in your room. They do have a white mode that you can dim. If you think you may want the option to add different colors, put the lights on a timer, or sync to music in the future, these are good to keep that as an option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length: </strong>100 feet | <strong>Color:</strong> Color changing | <strong>Power source: </strong>Corded electric</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-ksipze-100-foot-color-changing-led-lights-with-smart-app-control></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ksipze 100 foot Color Changing LED Lights with Smart App Control</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Ksipze RGB LED Strip Light" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/b3jPh8bFT9E7mLJ9v2fED5U2ka8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ksipze-rgb-led-strip-light-5ce4cbb3c7fc47c3a49e488d86a0f069.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For something more budget-friendly, the strip LED lights from Ksipze provide 100 feet of adjustable lighting. It also has a remote and can be controlled via an app. These allow you to change color, set a timer, set the lights to music, and toggle between solid lights, flashing, jumping, or fading. You can use the precision color feature to select the exact hue that you want.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These use an adhesive back to stick but it is not as sticky as some higher-end options. If your surface is uneven or resistant to sticky things, you might need to add double-sided tape to keep this light strip from peeling over time. Fortunately, these are super affordable and leave room in your budget to add extra adhesive if needed — they're typically on sale, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length:</strong> 100 feet | <strong>Color:</strong> Color changing | <strong>Power source: </strong>Corded electric</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-philips-hue-bluetooth-smart-lightstrip-gradient-ambience></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Splurge</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Philips Hue Bluetooth Smart Lightstrip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Philips Hue Bluetooth Gradient Ambiance Smart Lightstrip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Jd9KnHcAl4XanhNIqbNm0jdn7yg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/philips-hue-bluetooth-gradient-ambiance-smart-lightstrip-e0ab324e0595481a9e291546f0201ada.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This light strip does it all and looks great doing it. You can connect it to your smart home device, including Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Homekit. Phillips Hue also has other smart lighting so you can connect all of your lights and control them from one central place. The strip is more subdued than some others, with the lights hidden behind a thin opaque strip. The color-blending is seamless and more subtle than other less expensive options. There is a single-color option that is about half the price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s no denying that this is an expensive light strip and likely more than most people need if they just plan to use it once. But if you want to set up LED lights that will last and are easy to control, this is worth the cost. They are a bit shorter than other options but you can extend them up to 32 feet total without worry about pulling too much power.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length:</strong> 6 feet | <strong>Color:</strong> Gradient color | <strong>Power source: </strong>Corded electric</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-outdoor-commercial-electric-32-ft-indooroutdoor-led-strip-light-with-rf-remote></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Outdoor</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Commercial Electric 32 ft.

The strip is made of copper, which resists corrosion and rust. So even if it snows and rains, you can leave your light strip up. The adhesive is strong but may be impact by moisture over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These make great lights to use around the holidays. Because they are LEDs, they use less power than <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>traditional Christmas lights</a>. You can also adjust the color, brightness, and light pattern using the included remote. You can cut them to the length that you want, although if you are hanging them outside, keep in mind that each strip is only 32 feet long and you will need to plug it in for power.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length:</strong> 32 feet | <strong>Color:</strong> Color changing | <strong>Power source: </strong>Corded electric</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-tvs-hitlights-4-pre-cut-led-light-strips></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for TVs</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>HitLights 4 Pre-Cut LED Light Strips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="HitLights LED Strip Lights, 4 Pre-Cut 1 foot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KnPbHV2cPypgU3WkExKAxE6uusg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-hitlights-led-strip-lights-4-pre-cut-1-foot-fb5085b997a04a2c852b3613390b8bfb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These precut LED strip lights are the perfect setup for your TV. All you need to do is peel the backing off and use the built-in adhesive to stick them behind your TV. They also work great for shelves to add some interest and lighting that shows off your favorite collection. Each strip can be controlled via a remote or app to choose between 12 colors, 19 modes, flashing, and different brightness levels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your TV is a different shape, you may be better off getting a strip that you can cut to custom lengths. Each strip is one foot long. Given that most TVs now are wider than they are tall, this may mean that you need to combine some strips or make adjustments to avoid gaps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length: </strong>Four 1-foot strips | <strong>Color:</strong> Color changing | <strong>Power source: </strong>Corded electric</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-bedrooms-keepsmile-100-foot-led-strip-lights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Bedrooms</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Keepsmile 100 foot LED Strip Lights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Keepsmile 100ft Led Strip Lights (2 Rolls of 50ft) Bluetooth Smart App" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/x523IC4orsy0ZGthcll_uV2VvZU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/keepsmile-100ft-led-strip-lights-429c4babffde47d196a931b494fb07b1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These lights have 100 feet of continuous lighting that is perfect for your bedroom.

They are shorter, at just 16.4 feet long, but you can get a longer version if you need it — just expect to pay a bit more for the extra length.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length: </strong>16.4 feet | <strong>Lights/foot: </strong>9.1 lights per foot | <strong>Color:</strong> Color changing | <strong>Power source: </strong>Corded electric</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-closets-govee-motion-sensor-led-light-strip-with-memory-function></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Closets</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Govee Motion Sensor LED Light Strip with Memory Function</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Govee Motion Sensor LED Light Strip with Memory Function" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/qWhULRnivvO4DaIEI13xwNSiLGI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-govee-motion-sensor-led-light-strip-with-memory-function-3dd38b44f9f24e68badb99a14ec15341.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Adding strip lighting to your closet will instantly elevate an otherwise practical space. These lights only come in soft white, but that makes them great for a closet so that you can see the colors of your clothing and accessories while still enjoying some mood lighting. They are also slightly shorter than other options, perfect for smaller closet spaces and shelving. The strip has a motion sensor that automatically turns it on when it sense motion and turns it off after 15 seconds of no motion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They also have built-in corners; These flexible joints let you frame your shelving and clothing racks securely without worrying about adhesive coming off of tricky corners. The built-in 3M adhesive is strong and keeps the lighting sections in place. They are a bit on the expensive side, given their shorter length. But the superior adhesive and corner joints make them ideal for closets, where you likely don’t need a really long strip of lights.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length: </strong>9.8 feet | <strong>Lights/foot:</strong> 8.1 lights per foot | <strong>Color:</strong> Soft white | <strong>Power source: </strong>Corded electric<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-floors-daybetter-40-foot-dimmable-white-led-strip-light></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Floors</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Daybetter 40 foot Dimmable White LED Strip Light</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Daybetter 40 foot Dimmable White LED Strip Light" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/oFhqORLcshWst1XbQFBxcmS4TJg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-daybetter-40-foot-dimmable-white-led-strip-light-456e910bedcf40d7a86620a4d14aca86.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">LED strip lights are a great way to provide illumination to dark walkways without creating a tripping hazard in the process. These lights from Daybetter provide dimmable white lights, perfect for lighting up the floor without taking the focus off the rest of your decor. They are especially great for home theaters, where you want to recreate the movie theater experience while maintaining a reasonable budget. They also have a lot of lights per foot, resulting in a more even lighting effect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They come in daylight white or warm white and you can dim them to further customize the lighting. These strip lights do not have the capability to change color or a remote control, so they’re best to turn on and turn off without changing settings. You can adjust them using a knob on the control panel but it can be difficult to get it changed once you install them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length:</strong> 40 feet | <strong>Lights/foot:</strong> 18 lights per foot | <strong>Color:</strong> Daylight white or warm white | <strong>Power source: </strong>Corded electric</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-car-interiors-govee-rgbic-smart-car-led-strip-lights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Car Interiors</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Govee Smart Car LED Strip Lights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Govee Car LED Lights, Smart Car Interior Lights with App Control, RGB Inside Car Lights with DIY Mode and Music Mode, 2 Lines Design LED Lights for Cars..." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tt3y9eE_UH2nXsku-vbTZr1phQs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/govee-car-led-lights-smart-car-interior-lights-with-app-control-rgb-inside-car-lights-with-diy-mode-and-music-mode-2-lines-design-led-lights-for-cars-1261b02934f14298bf4ae401cbe51f1d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The customization of these light strips make them perfect for your vehicle. You can match your car’s interior exactly or choose another color to really make it pop. If you like decorating your car to match the holidays, these can be customized with multiple colors. You can use an app to make adjustments to the color, mode, or brightness, although we should put a disclaimer that you should only do that when you’re not driving — safety first.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The adhesive on the back is okay but may wear out faster if you live in an area where you track a lot of snow, ice, or dirt into your car. This is especially true if you put the lights on or near the floorboards. Each strip is just under 12 inches long and there are lengthy cords that run between them so that you can place them in your car and control via one toggle switch or app. These connect to power via the cigarette lighter in your car.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Length</strong>: Four 1-foot strips | <strong>Color:</strong> Color changing | <strong>Power source: </strong>Car adaptor</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-right-led-strip-lights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Right LED Strip Lights</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Length</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Look for the right lights that suit your space. Some are as short as 6 inches and are great for shelving, behind TVs, and smaller spaces that you want to highlight. Long LED strip lights can be 100 feet. You may also be able to connect strips together to expand their length. Just make sure that the power supply can support the additional load.

The most advanced, and most expensive, options can be controlled via your smart home device. If you want to be able to change the lights frequently, this is a great feature. For the more budget-conscious, choosing a model that does not have a remote feature can save money.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Settings</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to be able to customize your lighting, look for an LED strip light that has multiple modes, colors, music syncing, and a timer.
