Not to mention, she celebrates her birthday every year on June 5.</p><p>Similarly, her zodiac sign is Gemini, the sign known for its intelligence and outgoing personality. Maybe those traits did help her excel in business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/linda-002.jpg><p>Likewise, the former model, Linda, stands at the height of 5 feet 7 inches(170 cm) while her weight is 65 kg (142 lbs).</p><p>Aside from that, Holliday has long blonde hair and stunning brown eyes that go well with her fair skin complexion.</p><h2>Linda Holliday | Early Life and Education</h2><p>The savvy model, Linda Holliday, was born in the city of Jupiter, Florida, the United States of America, to her American parents.</p><p>Sadly, no information has been obtained on them; not even their names are known as of now.</p><p>Taking a closer look at it, Linda seems to be shielding her family from the prying eyes of the media. Hence, it might take a long time for her to warm up to the public or never at all.</p><p>Nonetheless, there is no wonder that Linda grew up in a caring and happy family. As for her education, the former model went to her local high school before enrolling at Vanderbilt University, located in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p>Likewise, she graduated with a Radiology degree in 1986 and started her career in the healthcare industry right after.</p><h2>Who Is Linda Holliday Married Too?- Husband & Kids</h2><p>Already an accomplished and intelligent businesswoman, Linda has found success in her career and work.</p><p>However, the same cannot be said regarding her personal life, especially her married life.</p><p>Despite the lack of information, it has come to light that Linda was married twice in her life. The names of her former spouses are still unknown at the moment.</p><p>Even though Linda has not spilled any information on her former spouse, she has not hidden information about her daughters.</p><p>If there is anything she is proud of in her past relationships, it is her twin daughters.</p><p>Similarly, it is mentioned that Holliday gave birth to her beautiful daughters between 1992 and 1993. Her daughter<strong> Katie</strong> came into the world 7 minutes earlier than <strong>Ashley.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/linda-005.jpg><p>As of now, her daughters have turned into fine young women and are thriving as Linda. The twin daughters graduated from Trinity College in Connecticut back in 2015.</p><p>During their college days, the two were active as writers and reporters for the college magazine.</p><p>Their articles mainly focused on beauty tips, health and well-being, and other glamorous stuff.</p><p>Likewise, the two were members of an acapella group called ‘The Dischords.‘ Katie was the group’s soprano, while Ashley sang Alto and Tenor.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sisters used the experience while studying in France and passionately infused that into their fashion and lifestyle blogs.</p><h2>Linda Holliday | Relationship With<a href=#> Bill Belichick</a></h2><p>Despite her two failed marriages and relationships, Linda never gave up on finding true love.&nbsp;And indeed, she found her passion in <strong>Bill “The Hoodie” Belichick</strong>, head coach of the New England Patriots.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Bill is considered one of the best coaches in the NFL and even has five Super Bowl wins to vouch for it. Likewise, the two lovebirds met for the first time in a nightclub in 2007.</p><p>At that time, Holliday was on a Girl’s Night Out with her close friends in Florida. The two started talking upon meeting, and before they knew it, they were dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/linda-004.jpg><p>Not to mention, their relationship has been going strong for 12 whole years. Holliday&nbsp;once wrote, “You have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love … I love … I love you!” in an Instagram post in 2018 on the occasion of Valentine’s Day. We can infer, from her caption, the intensity of their relationship.</p><p>Unlike her other personal information, Linda posts daily on her social media, updating people about their relationships.</p><p>Apart from dating each other, Holliday always cheers for her boyfriend. As of now, the two are living a blissful life with their children in Florida.</p><p>The couple has five children, two from Linda’s previous relationship and three from Bill’s former marriage.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyrie Irving Net Worth, Bio, Height, Wife, Children, Jersey, Net Worth >></a></h4><h2>What Does Linda Holliday Do For a Living?- Career</h2><p>It is true that right after graduation, Linda pursued her career in health care, but from an early age, she was attracted to the glamorous world.</p><p>Holliday participated in numerous beauty pageants and fashion shows in her younger days.</p><p>In fact, Holliday won Miss Arkansas pageants as runner-up twice in her career. However, having experience and interest in fashion, Linda struggled while working as a model.</p><p>The 60 years old even considers her modeling career a failure and disappointment. Maybe that is why she has never posted anything remotely related to her former modeling days.</p><p>After such a depressing start in the fashion industry, Linda then opened her business, Blue Indigo Boutique, in 2005. Sadly, the company did not do well, and it too closed down in 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>However, things have turned for good ever since she met her boyfriend, Bill Bellichick.</p><p>The NFL coach had recently divorced her wife, <strong>Debby,</strong> while Linda was dating someone else.

Salary and Income</h2><p>Known for her relationship more than her career, Linda has made a name for herself in the entertainment industry.
