It was here that Diego had reached the top.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Leading the team to two titles, including for the first time in history during their particular gold seasons.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Diego helped Argentina win the 1986 World Cup.</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During this time, Diego helped Argentina win the 1986 World Cup. He smashed the ball with his hand to score points against England in a 2-1 battle.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Maradona denied it on handball when asked about it, instead suggesting it as a “God’s hand.” And this statement has been one of the most repeated in the history of football.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Diego-helped-Argentina-win-World-cup-1986-Source-Give-me-Sport.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>At one point, his private life of the game caused a steep decline in his career. Ergo, the 1990 World Cup was a disappointment for both, Maradona and the Argentine team.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 1992, he forcefully left Napoli after discovering he had had cocaine. Unfortunately, in 1994, he was thrown out of the World Cup after a positive report on a drug test.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And for the next few years, Maradona played for teams such as Sevilla and Newell’s Old Boys before returning to Boca Juniors to complete his career.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Three Awesome Facts About Diego Maradona&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Maradona made his first football introduction on October 20, 1976, with </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Argentinos Junior when he was 15 years old.</span></li><li>In his childhood, Diego used to sleep with the football inside his shirt due to the fear of his football being stolen.</li><li>Diego was also the first player in the history of football to set a world record of his transfer fee twice.</li></ul><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Addiction Problems</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Diego Maradona became notorious for his cocaine addiction. He allegedly relied heavily on the drug from the mid-80s until about 2004.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unfortunately, his constant use of the drug affected his ability to play football, which became apparent since the star’s move to Napoli.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During Diego’s time in the Italian city, he received protection from mafia drug lords and women as he walked the streets undisturbed by beloved fans.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Finally, Napoli was humiliated since he was found positive with cocaine in 1991. He had also tested positive for ephedrine after playing two games at the 1994 World Cup.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Health Problems</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Maradona’s decline in health and fitness began even before he retired from football. While in Napoli, his way of life became uncontrollable.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And he spent most of the week participating in sports. He also started losing weight and started looking young enough towards the end of his career.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After retiring, Diego’s health began to decline dramatically. He soon gained weight, and at one time, he weighed 280 kgs. Finally, he underwent abdominal surgery in 2005 to deal with his obesity.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, Maradona continued to abuse alcohol. And as for the effects of binge drinking, he was hospitalized with cirrhosis in 2007.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rumors of his death soon followed, but Diego later appeared in a psychiatric ward after receiving treatment for his addiction problems.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, in 2007, he confessed to not drinking or taking drugs for many years.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But in 2018, Maradona fainted on the floor while watching Argentina play in the FIFA World Cup and emergency medical treatment.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Diego-Maradona-Source-Metro.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Throughout the match, Diego drank white wine, swore to nearby fans, and raised his middle finger to the cameras, which obviously caught the media’s attention.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Following that in 2019, he had received treatment for internal bleeding caused by a hernia.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Legal Issues</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During the 90s, Maradona struggled with many legal issues. The first one came in 1991 after Diego cleverly tried to meet prostitutes in Naples.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He indirectly called an illegal service to arrange a meeting in a line under the Italian authorities. And they recorded the entire conversation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Because of his involvement with cocaine and prostitutes, he&nbsp;eventually got charged with murder, including the distribution and possession of cocaine.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After being caught with cocaine that year, Maradona tried to flee from the police and fled to Argentina but was turned away by Italian authorities in tears.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Another big issue came in 1994 during the FIFA World Cup when he was tested positive for drugs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Before Maradona made headlines for his achievements, now it was making the headlines for all the bad reasons.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In one incident, the Argentine star opened fire on reporters with a pellet gun from his hotel, injuring several reporters. Not to mention, four years later he got sentenced to two years and ten months in prison.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Financial Problems</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Diego Maradona has been involved in tax disputes since his time of playing in Naples. Unpaid taxes had been collecting fines and fines for over 30 years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2009, Italian authorities publicly announced that Maradona owed $37 million in unpaid taxes, with 23 million Euros on interest alone.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Diego-Maradona-Source-The-Economic-Time.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a result, Police confiscated Diego’s jewelry to pay off about 42,000 Euros worth of debt. However, most of the remaining debt remains unpaid.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite that, Maradona insisted on having had no intention of paying taxes since Italian authorities mistreated him. As a result of these statements, Diego has been accused of blasphemy.</span></p><h3>Quotes</h3><ul><li><ul><li>“If I could apologize and go back and change history, I would do.
