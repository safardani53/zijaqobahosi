He first signed on with the Kansas City A’s in 1967 with a $12,500 salary to help support his family, and his incredibly fast left-handed pitch helped him rise quickly in the league. In 1971, he led the Oakland Athletics to their first pennant since 1930. The same season, Vida was awarded the pitcher’s Cy Young Award in addition to the American League’s MVP title, the youngest player to receive the title in the 20th century.</p><p>Despite this, his 1971 salary was just $14,000 — even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">President Nixon called Vida</a> “the most underpaid player in baseball.” Contract disputes began for Vida between himself and the Athletics owner Charlie Finley. In 1973, Vida told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>, “That man has soured me on baseball. No matter what he does for me in the future, I’ll never forget that he treated me like a damn colored boy.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In 1978, Vida was traded to the San Francisco Giants, but in 1983 while pitching for the Kansas City Royals, he faced a drug scandal. He and several teammates were caught with possession of cocaine, which led to 81 days in prison and a suspension from playing baseball. He played again for the Giants after, but his substance abuse continued to follow him. In 2005, he was arrested on multiple DUI charges. All of this combined, he has suggested, led to his exclusion from the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p><p>In 1989, Vida married his now ex-wife Peggy Shannon, with whom he had two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">twin daughters in early '90s. (He also had an older son, Derrick Blue,</a> from another relationship.)</p><p>Vida and Peggy divorced in 1996. Despite all his troubles, he was celebrated for his talent, dedication, and unwavering values.</p><p>Our condolences go out to Vida’s friends, family, and fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfq7alrYybo66dXZiutr%2FEZqafZZSarrW0</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fvida-blue-cause-of-death.html&text=What%20Was%20Vida%20Blues%20Cause%20of%20Death%3f%20Star%20Pitcher%20Died%20at%2073&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvida-blue-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvida-blue-cause-of-death.html&title=What%20Was%20Vida%20Blues%20Cause%20of%20Death%3f%20Star%20Pitcher%20Died%20at%2073" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fvida-blue-cause-of-death.html&title=What%20Was%20Vida%20Blues%20Cause%20of%20Death%3f%20Star%20Pitcher%20Died%20at%2073" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fvida-blue-cause-of-death.html&title=What%20Was%20Vida%20Blues%20Cause%20of%20Death%3f%20Star%20Pitcher%20Died%20at%2073" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvida-blue-cause-of-death.html&description=What%20Was%20Vida%20Blues%20Cause%20of%20Death%3f%20Star%20Pitcher%20Died%20at%2073" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./yomo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Yomo>&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tom-vu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Vu">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
