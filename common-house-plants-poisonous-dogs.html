But the number one poisonous tree is the Yew, so make sure you definitely don’t have this in your garden.</li><li><strong>Bothersome bulbs:&nbsp;</strong>Bulbs can be tempting for dogs due to their ball shape and the fact they are buried, however many are poisonous including hyacinths, daffodils, alliums and tulips – so watch out.</li><li><strong>Check the positioning:</strong>&nbsp;Adapt the position of plants to keep dangers out of reach. Most dogs won’t usually eat ivy, but it can be potentially hazardous if eaten in very large quantities. So, if you have large quantities of ivy, especially with berries, consider cutting them back away from ground level</li><li><strong>Quantity control:</strong>&nbsp;Be very aware of what you have in your garden. For example, though apples are generally safe for dogs to eat, in large quantities they can be potentially hazardous due to the seeds. Aim to reduce the number of apple trees you have or clear up the fallen apples in the autumn, so they don’t all get eaten.</li><li><strong>Safe for summer:</strong>&nbsp;For lots of colour,&nbsp;plants like roses, lilies, hollyhocks and camelias are very dog safe.</li><li><strong>Perfect pots:&nbsp;</strong>For pots, borders and hanging baskets go for bedding plants like snapdragons, petunias, salvias, fuchsias and sunflowers.</li><li><strong>Go-to greenery:</strong>&nbsp;Choose a native, mixed Hawthorn hedge, which is not only good for wildlife but is also a lot more dog-friendly than Laurel hedges which are often toxic (with the exception of Bay). For lower lying foliage, grasses and ferns are generally good dog safe options.&nbsp;</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoJ6g49sb2lnk6S6rrvNZp%2BoraOaerG4wKerrGWgpLa0u82orKxllKS0tHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcommon-house-plants-poisonous-dogs.html&text=Top%2010%20common%20house%20and%20garden%20plants%20that%20are%20actually%20poisonous%20to%20dogs&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcommon-house-plants-poisonous-dogs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcommon-house-plants-poisonous-dogs.html&title=Top%2010%20common%20house%20and%20garden%20plants%20that%20are%20actually%20poisonous%20to%20dogs" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcommon-house-plants-poisonous-dogs.html&title=Top%2010%20common%20house%20and%20garden%20plants%20that%20are%20actually%20poisonous%20to%20dogs" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcommon-house-plants-poisonous-dogs.html&title=Top%2010%20common%20house%20and%20garden%20plants%20that%20are%20actually%20poisonous%20to%20dogs" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcommon-house-plants-poisonous-dogs.html&description=Top%2010%20common%20house%20and%20garden%20plants%20that%20are%20actually%20poisonous%20to%20dogs" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./travis-scott-stoic-first-time-kylie-jenner-pregnancy-announcement.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Travis Scott looks stoic as he's seen for first time since Kylie Jenner 'pregnancy' announcement dur">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tesco-selling-teddy-fleece-duvet-sale.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tesco is selling its Teddy Fleece Duvet set for half price meaning you can can have the cosiest slee">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
