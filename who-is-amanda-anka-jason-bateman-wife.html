His wife of over 20 years, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Amanda Anka</a>, is also no stranger to the spotlight: The actress and the producer has appeared in several TV shows and is a co-producer on The Morning Show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's f------ great. [...] She's the best," Bateman told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GQ</a> of his wife in 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And Anka is equally as enamored with her husband. "He's the most sensitive, generous man without being fragile, which is interesting to me," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2019, when Bateman won a SAG Award for his performance in Ozark, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he praised his wife</a> and their two daughters, Franny and Maple, in his acceptance speech: "without you, none of it would be enjoyable and it probably wouldn't be possible [...] I love you more than I even tell you I do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2023, Bateman won yet another SAG Award for his role in Ozark. While behind the winner's podium, he expressed his gratitude for Anka and their two daughters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Thank you to my wife Amanda</a>, my two kids at home, Maple [and] Francesca, they made me feel like I was a good dad even though I was gone for six months every year. They're better actors than I am," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So who is the woman who has been standing by Bateman throughout most of his career?

As he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ET Canada</a> in 2011, Bateman is the "actor in the family." He added, "He's … a very smart boy, a wonderful guy for my daughter."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-has-appeared-in-dozens-of-films-and-tv-shows></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She has appeared in dozens of films and TV shows</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Bateman may be the actor in the Anka family now, his wife has also had some experience in front of the camera.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the '90s and early 2000s, Anka had small roles in a number of well-known TV shows. In 1992, she played a vampire in the film version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She also had small guest roles in Renegade, Beverly Hills, 90210, ER, The Fosters and Bones.

In 2019, she took on her first project as a producer with AppleTV+'s The Morning Show. Other producers included <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Reese Witherspoon</a>, who star in the show.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-met-bateman-when-they-were-teenagers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She met Bateman when they were teenagers</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anka and Bateman met in 1988 at an L.A. Kings game — both were around 18 or 19 years old at the time. They became friends but didn't initially have a romantic connection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I just wasn't into where he was at," Anka explained to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GQ</a>, referring to Bateman's party-centric lifestyle at the time. Eventually, Bateman's struggle with drugs and alcohol in his 20s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>caused him to lose job opportunities</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Having thought, 'This is really fun,' and staying at the party a little bit too long, I'd lost my place in line in the business; it was a case of trying to claw that back towards the end of the '90s, and not getting a lot of great responses," Bateman later said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-started-dating-bateman-in-1998></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She started dating Bateman in 1998</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE</a> reported in 2006, Anka and Bateman started dating in 1998, 10 years after they first met.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple married three years later in 2001 in Malibu.
