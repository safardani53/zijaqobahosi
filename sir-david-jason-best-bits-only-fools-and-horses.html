Sir David on...</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>NICHOLAS LYNDHURST</h2><p>DEL Boy and Rodney are regarded as the greatest double act in British sitcom <span id=41d5d11f-feb4-4027-bce4-e461987172bf class=suggested-link>history</span>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE DAVID JASON">READ MORE DAVID JASON</h2><p>They have appeared in every episode, from 1981 to 2003, and turned Sir David and Nicholas into national treasures. Fellow cast members including Roger Lloyd-Pack, as ­Trigger, and John Challis as Boycie, were also huge hits on the show.</p><p>On his co-star, Sir David says: “You couldn’t have had a better co-partner than Nic.</p><p>“We liked and respected each other so much, we were genuinely good friends.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>TRIGGER</h2><p>THE dozy road sweeper with the deadpan delivery was one of Only Fools’ most beloved characters, regularly landing the biggest laughs.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>Also appearing in the doc, Chris Wadsworth editor of Only Fools said: “John got complaints if Trigger wasn’t in an episode long enough.</p><p>“The Trigger fan club would write and say ‘Trigger was only given half a dozen lines in this episode, what are you doing?’”</p><p>Tessa Peake-Jones, who played Del’s partner Raquel, added: “Roger was brilliant. His secret was the very serious face. He treated it like a tragedy, as if playing Hamlet.”</p><p>Donal Woods, production designer, said: “I remember David and Nic saying Trigger always got the laugh in the end. They’d set it up.”</p><p>Director Tony Dow added: “Everyone would be doing dialogue, dialogue, dialogue and in would come Trigger with one line — and it would bring the house down. It must have driven Nic and David mad.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/first-entry-fools-horses-screengrabs-530529.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>CHRISTMAS CRACKERS (1981)</h2><p>ONLY Fools’ debut series aired in 1981 to mixed reviews.</p><p>Despite the shaky start, the <a href=#>BBC</a> wanted writer John Sullivan to make a festive special at the end of its run — but only told him six weeks before Christmas, sparking panic among the crew who filmed the episode just a week before transmission.</p><p>Sir David explains: “Bless him, John Sullivan was under a lot of pressure. It really wasn’t enough time to do it for Christmas. Two weeks before Christmas we were going, ‘Are we doing the show?’.</p><p>He said, ‘Yes, yes’. We said, ‘Where’s <span id=a5b58abf-26a2-4a60-bffc-b1bc5b324e21 class=suggested-link>the script</span>?’, he said, ‘We haven’t got a script yet’.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ONLY FOOLS v MINDER</h2><p>BY 1985, Only Fools was becoming a big TV favourite. The BBC viewed the show as the jewel in its crown going into Christmas and put it up against ITV’s biggest show, Minder, at a time when few could record a show they didn’t watch.</p><p>John Sullivan had been given budget of £850,000 — huge at the time — to shoot the episode, To Hull And Back, which saw the Trotters travel to Amsterdam by boat, driven by Uncle Albert (Buster Merryfield).</p><p>Sir David says: “I remember that we were disappointed because Minder was one of the big, successful shows that <a href=#>ITV</a> had.</p><p>That was so dangerous because we thought we would lose a lot of the audience to ITV. He adds: “I suppose in the mind of Michael Grade (former BBC controller) it was, ‘Well, we’re going to pinch your audience as we’ve got the best show’.”</p><p>Only Fools reigned supreme attracting 17million viewers, compared to Minder starring <a href=#>Dennis Waterman</a> and George Cole, which brought in 12million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fools-horses-255686062.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>MOST EXPENSIVE JOKE</h2><p>DURING To Hull And Back, there was one scene that took up most of John Sullivan’s giant budget.</p><p>The boat Del Boy and Rodney were travelling in predictably ran off course, given veteran sailor Uncle Albert was behind the wheel.</p><p>To get back on track, Sullivan came up with the idea that the boat would drift out to the North Sea, where they would encounter an <span id=0aba5221-d5ed-421b-9bc5-7786531178a1 class=suggested-link>oil</span> rig and ask a bemused worker directions to <span id=44db0195-453e-431e-ac4d-94253e4e28bb class=suggested-link>Holland</span>.</p><p>Sir David explains: “We were going to Amsterdam and how to get there was a bit of a problem, so we thought we’d hire a boat. We set out but problem was that we soon realised Uncle Albert wasn’t quite as equipped at navigation as he purported to be.</p><p>“The joke was we stopped at the bottom of the oil rig and Derek Trotter shouts out ‘Oi, John, which way to Holland?’</p><p>“That episode was one of the, if not the, most expensive jokes ever perpetrated by the BBC if not for <a href=#>television</a> the world over.”</p><p>The clip lasted just 40 seconds but involved a 12-hour round trip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1996-time-hands-synonymous-del-867838915.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>THE 1996 TRILOGY</h2><p>ONLY Fools was meant to go out with a bang in 1996 with three new episodes, including one where the Trotters would finally become ­millionaires.</p><p>The first episode, Heroes And Villains, featured the iconic scene when Del Boy and Rodney dress up as <a href=#>Batman</a> and Robin for a fancy dress party at a pub which, unbeknown to them, had been cancelled and replaced with a wake. En-route in their costumes they foiled a street mugging of a local councillor.</p><p>Bosses were so desperate to keep the scene under wraps they had to close off the High Street in Bristol, where Only Fools’ location scenes were shot.</p><p>Production designer Donal Woods explains: “We blocked off the streets with fences and black drapes and put scaffolding up. We just wanted to keep it a secret for Christmas Day.”</p><p>The second episode, Modern Men, saw the brothers show rare emotion after Rodney’s wife Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong) suffered a miscarriage, but the scenes won acclaim by viewers who felt the tragic storyline was wonderfully handled.</p><p>Tessa Peake-Jones says: “I remember John Sullivan talking about it and saying, ‘I don’t know how this will go down in the sitcom world but I wanted to do it’, so I think it was quite important for him to. As usual, he liked stretching the boundaries a bit.”</p><p>The final instalment, Time On Our Hands, became synonymous with Del Boy and Rodney fainting inside Sotheby’s auction house as a maritime stopwatch they found in a garage fetched £6.2million.</p><p>They were, at last, the <a href=#>millionaires</a> that Del Boy always predicted they would be.</p><p>The episode was watched by a record-breaking 24.3million viewers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>THE 2001-2003 FINALE</h2><p>THE BBC were so desperate for more Only Fools after its 1996 swansong that they convinced John Sullivan to write three more ­episodes: If They Could See Us Now...!, Strangers on the Shore and Sleepless In Peckham.</p><p>David Jason admits he and the cast missed the show so much, they moved filming of their other ­projects to shoot the episodes which ran in consecutive years.</p><p>However, one of the Trotter clan was missing. Uncle Albert star Buster Merryfield had passed away in 1999 but his character was still front and centre of the specials.</p><p>Having lost their <a href=#>money</a> in a stock market crash, the final episode, Sleepless In Peckham, saw Del and Rodney in the money again, after discovering crafty Albert had left them £145,000 each in his will.</p><p>Recalling that last ever scene, director Tony Dow says: “I remember being in that studio and saying to the floor ­manager, ‘That’s it, that’s the end of Only Fools And Horses’. The whole place exploded, the audience went potty.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Sir David added: “We got a standing ovation in that studio for seven minutes. They wouldn’t let us go.”</p><ul><li><strong>Only Fools And Horses: Greatest Christmas Moments airs on Channel 5 at 9pm tomorrow.</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1988-del-boy-met-raquel-867837175.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGplZoF1hJBvZqyhomKxosLInWSjmaOku26uxKyrZpqZqcBuu82lsGaen6S5tHnAp5tmoJ%2BnwKa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsir-david-jason-best-bits-only-fools-and-horses.html&text=Sir%20David%20Jason%20addresses%20Nicholas%20Lyndhurst%20rift%20rumours%20as%20he%20reveals%20backstage%20secrets%20of%20Only%20Fo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsir-david-jason-best-bits-only-fools-and-horses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsir-david-jason-best-bits-only-fools-and-horses.html&title=Sir%20David%20Jason%20addresses%20Nicholas%20Lyndhurst%20rift%20rumours%20as%20he%20reveals%20backstage%20secrets%20of%20Only%20Fo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsir-david-jason-best-bits-only-fools-and-horses.html&title=Sir%20David%20Jason%20addresses%20Nicholas%20Lyndhurst%20rift%20rumours%20as%20he%20reveals%20backstage%20secrets%20of%20Only%20Fo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsir-david-jason-best-bits-only-fools-and-horses.html&title=Sir%20David%20Jason%20addresses%20Nicholas%20Lyndhurst%20rift%20rumours%20as%20he%20reveals%20backstage%20secrets%20of%20Only%20Fo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsir-david-jason-best-bits-only-fools-and-horses.html&description=Sir%20David%20Jason%20addresses%20Nicholas%20Lyndhurst%20rift%20rumours%20as%20he%20reveals%20backstage%20secrets%20of%20Only%20Fo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swift-is-a-midnight-dream-with-blake-lively-in-nyc.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift Is a Midnight Dream With Blake Lively in NYC">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-is-jeffrey-nash-s-net-worth-also-know-about-his-property-and-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much is Jeffrey Nash's Net Worth?
