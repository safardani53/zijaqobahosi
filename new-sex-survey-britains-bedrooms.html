Almost a quarter either don't do it at all or just once a week, with the largest chunk of this demographic - 62 per cent - having sex between two and three times a week.</p><p>Eighty-four per cent of <a href=#>millennials are sexually active</a> at least twice a week but it's the 18 to 21-year-olds who are setting an impressive pace: 89 per cent of them are sexually active at least twice a week, while 22 per cent of them are active five times.</p><h2>A third of 18-21-year-olds have cheated</h2><p>The younger generation also appear to be a lot more unfaithful.</p><p>Of those in a relationship, only 18 per cent of the over 38s said they had cheated on their partner but a staggering 29 per cent of the youngest group said they’d had sex with someone else — a big jump up from 19 per cent last year.</p><p>Millennials (22 to 37-year-olds) have also been naughty with 22 per cent of them — up from 14 per cent in 2018 — saying they’d been unfaithful.</p><h2>They're also the most promiscuous</h2><p>A whopping 78 per cent of 18-21 year olds said they’d had six or more sexual partners.</p><p>Just 51 per cent of millennials and 61 per cent of over-38 group had similar numbers.</p><p>The 18-21 year olds are also having the most sex in public, with 64 per cent of them taking their sex outdoors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475164743.jpg><p>But despite all this sex, the use of 'herbal' performance-enhancing supplements has surged drastically, as men take products like like Virility Max and Golden Root.</p><p>In 2015, only 9 per cent of men admitted to using these supplements to maintain <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 'stronger' erection.</a>&nbsp;In 2018/2019 that number exploded to 29 per cent.</p><h2>Men dream of seeing their partner have sex with someone else</h2><p>For Britain’s men, three is definitely not a crowd when it comes to their saucy imaginations.</p><p>Not only does a threesome remain the nation’s favourite sexual fantasy, almost a third of men dream about ‘cuckoldry’ — the act of seeing their partner having sex with someone else.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/RB-COMPOSITE-PIE-CHART-V2.jpg><p>Maybe it’s voyeurism but a quick straw poll of mates came up with the suggestion that the men who want others to service their wives are just lazy couch potatoes, happy to sit back and munch Pringles while someone else does their marital chores.</p><p>Almost 40 per cent of men and women over the age of 38 said cuckoldry was the sexual fantasy they’d most like to try in 2019.</p><h2>90% of men pleasure themselves four times a week</h2><p>An astonishing 90 per cent of men admit to masturbating at least four times a week and 22 per cent on a daily basis.</p><p>Sisters are doing it for themselves with almost as much enthusiasm: 71 per cent admit to masturbating at least three times a week, while 15 per cent are doing it every day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GL-4-masturbation1.jpg><p>These figures show a big rise since 2015, when only&nbsp;1 per cent of women were daily self-pleasuring, while the overwhelming majority — 67 per cent — were doing it 2-3 times a week.</p><p>Blokes have actually tailed off over that same period, dropping down from a daily high of 41 per cent in 2016, and will need to work hard to maintain their slight edge in an increasingly close-fought contest.</p><h2>Sex toys aren't just for the ladies</h2><p>Women have traditionally been more willing to use toys to sort themselves out but the new survey reveals that men are getting tech-savvy too.</p><p>In 2018, only 24 per cent of them said they had used a sex toy.</p><p>This year that number has more than doubled to 58 per cent and their weapon of choice is the <a href=#>'fleshlight</a>', a torch-shaped toy for men which mimics a vagina.</p><p>Women’s use of toys has gone up too, from 74 per cent last year to 79 per cent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475164737.jpg><h2>A third of young people caught an STI last year</h2><p>All age groups have seen an increase in the catching of sexually transmitted diseases.</p><p>A disturbing 29 per cent of 18 to 21-year-olds admit they caught something last year — up from 19 per cent last year — while 22 per cent of millennials said they’d contracted one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GL-3-STDs-2.jpg><p>Even 11 per cent of those old enough to know better, aged over 38, had also picked up something.</p><p>It looks like sex in Britain is getting riskier, with Brits increasingly happy to play Russian roulette with their health, preferring to have casual sex ‘bareback’ — without a condom.</p><p>38 per cent of 18 to 21-year-olds said they’d sometimes had casual sex in the past year without insisting on protection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GL-7-CONDOM-USE-v2-1.jpg><p>Millennials&nbsp;played it only slightly safer: 35 per cent sometimes had unprotected casual sex.</p><p>The oldest group were the biggest gamblers, with 45 per cent prepared to have casual sex without a condom.</p><h2>38% of men watch porn every day</h2><p>Given Britain’s appetite for self-pleasure, it’s no surprise that porn-watching is going through the roof - 38 per cent of men say they watch it every day, while 74 per cent watch at least four times a week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GL-5-porn1.jpg><p>Women are getting a stronger taste for it too. In 2016 only 2 per cent said they used pornography 4-5 times week. In 2019 that number has jumped to 32 per cent.</p><p>The increased use of smartphones and faster internet access have brought pornography to the lives of more Brits — especially women.</p><p>Last year, only 3 per cent of women watched porn every day. In 2019 that figure has grown to 16 per cent.</p><h2>82% disappointed by package size in d*** pics</h2><p>Brits are happy to flaunt their cheeky bits now more than ever, with a whopping 88 per cent of women saying they have sent someone a naked picture of themselves via text, social media or electronic means.</p><p>This is a huge leap in female exhibitionism from 2015, when only 64 per cent of women were prepared to send someone a nude picture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GL-1-Naughty-Selfie-v2v21.jpg><p>Men were even less coy, with 83 per cent saying that they had sent a nude shot of themselves.</p><p>But while the babes of Blighty are more brazen than ever, they’re not impressed with the state of the nation’s manhood.</p><p>When it comes to selfies, size definitely matters: a massive 82 per cent of women were disappointed by the d*** pics they had been sent over the last year.</p><p>But with so much porn being watched, it's hardly surprising they find the d*** pics of mere mortals prove a let down after watching the professionals.</p><p>Time to try the zoom lens, guys.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>A spokesperson for British Condoms commented: “There seems to be an overall feeling that more and more people are becoming less satisfied in general with their sex lives in general.</p><p>“When asking a few of the respondents why this was, they unilaterally responded that things weren't exciting enough.</p><p>“Digging deeper, we think that this is related to increase in porn usage. Porn sites glorify porn scenes to make them look 'normal' - so when people don't have that experience in the bedroom, some are looking at this as 'failure'.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Lad admits he found 'custard' coming out of his privates on The Sex Clinic</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbYNxhJRraGimlax6tLHXZqquqqaaxm6u0aKrmqGeqHqjscOrpqilo2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnew-sex-survey-britains-bedrooms.html&text=New%20sex%20survey%20lifts%20the%20covers%20on%20what%27s%20going%20on%20in%20Britain%27s%20bedrooms%2c%20including%20what%20men%20really%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnew-sex-survey-britains-bedrooms.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnew-sex-survey-britains-bedrooms.html&title=New%20sex%20survey%20lifts%20the%20covers%20on%20what%27s%20going%20on%20in%20Britain%27s%20bedrooms%2c%20including%20what%20men%20really%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnew-sex-survey-britains-bedrooms.html&title=New%20sex%20survey%20lifts%20the%20covers%20on%20what%27s%20going%20on%20in%20Britain%27s%20bedrooms%2c%20including%20what%20men%20really%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnew-sex-survey-britains-bedrooms.html&title=New%20sex%20survey%20lifts%20the%20covers%20on%20what%27s%20going%20on%20in%20Britain%27s%20bedrooms%2c%20including%20what%20men%20really%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnew-sex-survey-britains-bedrooms.html&description=New%20sex%20survey%20lifts%20the%20covers%20on%20what%27s%20going%20on%20in%20Britain%27s%20bedrooms%2c%20including%20what%20men%20really%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-most-shocking-celebrity-breakups-of-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Most Shocking Celebrity Breakups of 2023">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./montego-glover-the-witch-into-the-woods-stephen-sondeim.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Montego Glover Honors Sondheim As Witch In Into The Woods (Exclusive)  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
