He grew up in a family of four, including his&nbsp;father, mother Priscilla, and brother. He has gone on record to claim that&nbsp;they were his greatest cheerleaders.</p><p>Growing up, he discovered his passion for performing arts and was actively engaged in the community theatres, where he learned to act, dance, and sing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Although he was an artist by passion and profession, he graduated with a major in&nbsp;mathematics from&nbsp;Chapman University.</p><p>While on the subject of his bio,&nbsp;Ciarlelli stands at a height of&nbsp;5 feet&nbsp;6 inches&nbsp;(1.68&nbsp;m).</p><h2>Brock Ciarlelli Started His On-Screen Career In 'The Middle'</h2><p>He was still a high school student when&nbsp;he went from theatres to film in 2009. This transition happened&nbsp;after he got the role of Brad Bottig in The Middle. He starred as the lead character, Sue’s ex-boyfriend, and later a best friend who discovers that he is gay. After this, he appeared in some TV shows, movies, and a Broadway show. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>More from The Middle:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>What Is Atticus Shaffer Net Worth Now? Also Family Details, Parents, Height & More</a></p><p>Even after making it big with his role in The Middle, he is still the same down-to-earth and humble guy he’d&nbsp;always been. He believes that sharpening one's skills is an ongoing process.&nbsp;So he still takes two acting classes every week.</p><p>Not only that, but he also takes his mom’s wise words&nbsp;to heart and takes a weekly tap dances class despite his busy schedule.</p><p>His mother's words:&nbsp;"The more interests you have, the more interesting of a person you are." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who Is Brock Ciarelli’s Boyfriend?&nbsp;Is He Gay?</h2><p>Playing the role of a gay guy in a popular series sure does give rise to speculations about the actor’s sexuality.</p><p><strong>See More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Rumored Gay Neil Flynn's Wife & Family Exists; Not Where Fans Expect</a></p><p>It was similar for Ciarelli as well. In The Middle, he was paired with his on-screen gay partner Corbin Bleu who stars as Luke, a handsome drummer. His character gathered the&nbsp;courage to&nbsp;ask&nbsp;Luke out. Eventually, Luke becomes his boyfriend, and the two end up deeply in love.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>On-Screen Gay Partner:</strong> Brock Ciarelli as Brad poses alongside his on-screen boyfriend Corbin Bleu as Luke (Photo: IMDB)</p><p>Despite his lauded gay character, the actor has not come out as gay in real life. But then again, the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and hence the gay rumors spread on.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Brock Ciarelli&nbsp;Dating Someone?</h2><p>Surprisingly little is known about Ciarelli's love life. A funny and witty guy, he has only shed some light on the topic of love through his posts on Instagram. Still, it's hard to tell if they're just&nbsp;light-hearted jokes or posts made in sincerity.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>You May Also Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Charlie McDermott Married Or Casually Dating?

It's pretty obvious that this one was a joke&nbsp;considering their vast age difference, and Kaling&nbsp;already has a baby with another man now.</p><p>Besides these posts, Ciarelli’s love life is a mystery waiting to unfold. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Update: Brock Ciarelli Has a Boyfriend</h2><p>As many had speculated for so long,&nbsp;Ciarelli finally came out as gay.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, the actor has been flaunting his love for his adorable boyfriend, Kameron Tarlow, on his Instagram, and so is his boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>On August 9, 2021,&nbsp;Ciarelli posted a slideshow of pictures featuring the couple looking dapper in gray suits, albeit, the caption read, "Silly in suits."&nbsp;</p><p>In one of these snaps, the couple could be seen losing themselves in one another's embrace whilst landing a loving kiss.</p><p>A picture truly does speak a thousand words!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwrtGomqRlk56us7jEpaOiZZKevG6txp5koJmpY7W1ucs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrock-ciarlelli-bio-age-gay-html.html&text=Brock%20Ciarlelli%20Bio%3a%20Reel%20Gay%20Actor%20Has%20Boyfriend%20In%20Real%20Life%3f%20Dating%20Status&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrock-ciarlelli-bio-age-gay-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrock-ciarlelli-bio-age-gay-html.html&title=Brock%20Ciarlelli%20Bio%3a%20Reel%20Gay%20Actor%20Has%20Boyfriend%20In%20Real%20Life%3f%20Dating%20Status" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrock-ciarlelli-bio-age-gay-html.html&title=Brock%20Ciarlelli%20Bio%3a%20Reel%20Gay%20Actor%20Has%20Boyfriend%20In%20Real%20Life%3f%20Dating%20Status" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrock-ciarlelli-bio-age-gay-html.html&title=Brock%20Ciarlelli%20Bio%3a%20Reel%20Gay%20Actor%20Has%20Boyfriend%20In%20Real%20Life%3f%20Dating%20Status" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrock-ciarlelli-bio-age-gay-html.html&description=Brock%20Ciarlelli%20Bio%3a%20Reel%20Gay%20Actor%20Has%20Boyfriend%20In%20Real%20Life%3f%20Dating%20Status" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./louis-partridge-girlfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does 'Enola Holmes' Actor Louis Partridge Have a Girlfriend?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./netflix-who-is-khat-bell-in-the-circle-us-season-2-meet-the-player-on-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Netflix: Who is Khat Bell in The Circle US season 2?
