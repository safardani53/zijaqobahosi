Irish music legend Sinead O’Connor has died at the age of just 56.</p><p>"She was a troubled and beautiful soul. Fearless, uncompromising, shocking, courageous. She was a rebel at heart.</p><p>“She took on the Catholic Church. She used a primetime performance on US TV to stage a protest, even as everybody told her it could ruin her career.</p><p>"Above all else, she enchanted millions with a song that’s known across the world and across the generations. Few people can truly say their voice defined an era.</p><p>"But Sinead’s did. Put simply, nothing compared to Sinead O’Connor.”</p><p>Irish presenter Dara O'Briain wrote on twitter: "Ah s***e,&nbsp;<a href=#>Sinead O’Connor</a>&nbsp;has died.</p><p>"That’s just very sad news.
