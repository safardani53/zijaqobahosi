Furthermore, the surgeon arrived with Austrian model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>Katharina Mazepa</a>, who Page Six reported was his "new girlfriend," while the reality star showed up an hour later with co-star Larsa Pippen by her side.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-may-16-2022-lisa-hochstein-and-lenny-hochstein-confirm-their-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>May 16, 2022: Lisa Hochstein and Lenny Hochstein confirm their breakup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The couple confirmed their breakup</a> to PEOPLE on May 16, with a spokesperson for Lisa saying, "With two young children involved, as a mom I'm going to focus all of my energy and time on them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The statement continued, "I'm blindsided by [Lenny's] behavior and reckless handling of the situation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While neither Lenny nor Lisa had officially filed for divorce at the time, Lenny confirmed his relationship with Katharina. "Nothing happened between us until we decided on the divorce, and Lisa was aware of my plans before anything happened between Katharina and myself," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he told PEOPLE</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lenny also explained why official divorce proceedings have yet to be filed, despite having "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>contemplated divorce for the last several years</a>." "Our lawyers are trying to negotiate this but filing will be done soon," he said.

The formal paperwork he filed on May 23 cited "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for their split.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-111 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other details in the filing, which was obtained by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>Page Six</a>, included that the "marriage is irretrievably broken and there is no present hope for a meaningful reconciliation." Lenny and Lisa signed a prenuptial agreement before they wed in 2009, and, per the terms, Lenny will pay spousal support to Lisa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-113 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lenny also stated in the filing that he will "fully provide for all of the children's needs" and added he'd like "frequent time-sharing" of the children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-june-19-2022-lisa-hochstein-posts-a-fathers-day-tribute-without-lenny-hochstein></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>June 19, 2022: Lisa Hochstein posts a Father's Day tribute without Lenny Hochstein</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-116 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lisa appeared to throw shade at Lenny on Father's Day when she posted a photo with her kids on her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Instagram Story</a> without their dad. "Happy Father's Day to all the amazing dads out there who put their families first," the text read alongside a picture of the reality star and her kids.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aug-1-2022-lisa-hochstein-claims-she-was-financially-strangled-by-lenny-hochstein></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-120 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aug. 1, 2022: Lisa Hochstein claims she was "financially strangled" by Lenny Hochstein</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-121 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Lisa and Lenny Hochstein.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>lisa hochstein/instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-122 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Aug. 1, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lisa reportedly filed legal paperwork</a> against her estranged husband, claiming that she's been "financially strangled" by Lenny.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-124 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her latest divorce paperwork, Lisa alleged that Lenny "retaliates by restricting [her] access to funds" whenever she "does not acquiesce to each and every one of [his] demands" in the midst of their divorce, per the documents obtained by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>Page Six</a>. (PEOPLE <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>confirmed</a> the documents' content with Lisa's team.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-126 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The funds in question apparently stemmed from a joint credit card overseen by Lenny that Lisa claimed was intended to be used for "personal expenses, expenses for the household and expenses for the parties' children."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-128 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a statement to PEOPLE, Lenny claimed, "Lisa uses these court filings to portray me poorly in the press."

"As Lenny pointed out in his own public statement, they have been separated and sleeping in different bedrooms for months now and living separate lives for months now. It is only after Lenny's separation that we began dating and having a relationship," she told the publication.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-137 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mazepa added, "How can [Lisa] have had 'no idea' about us going out together when she had time to directly threaten me and [my] home with statements like 'you are going to pay' [and] 'I will destroy you'?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-139 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lisa, however, categorically denied the claims by Mazepa. "This is just another attempt at a woman who is a self-admitted home wrecker to further try to stay relevant. Hopefully her 15 minutes will be up soon," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lisa told PEOPLE exclusively</a>.

The trailer flashed back to happier times between the couple before showing Lisa saying, "I'm losing my best friend, losing my husband to another woman."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-144 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The drama continued when Lisa revealed that her personal trainer dropped her because "Lenny has him training the mistress." The reality star later yelled into a phone, presumably to Lenny, referring to Mazepa. "You bring that girl anywhere near my f–king kids, there's going to be a huge f–king problem.
