"I want them to be free in spirit, free in thought, free to be themselves. The more you know yourself, the more you can govern yourself, the more you live your truth, the happier your existence."</p><p>"So, if they can't get that in a household with their father and their mother, how the f--k do I send them out into the world with that kind of confidence?" he continued.</p><p>He also later said of Kai: "They know I love them. They see me trying. They're like, 'I'm happy.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Neither of his kids appear to have social media profiles, but Marlon has posted about them over the years. For instance, in November 2023, he captioned a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo featuring his kids</a>: "Squad ... so proud of the offspring. Wayans for life."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In May 2023, he posted a tribute <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kai's birthday</a>, which included: "Be you! Your best you! You’re the gift and I’m wrapping paper."

I wouldn’t change one effing thing about you."</p><p>Marlon also captioned an adorable 2020 pic of him and Shawn as "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Me and the sequel</a>."

He made a few exceptions, however. In a January 2013 appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wendy Williams Show</a>, he revealed that he had once insisted on living in separate houses to keep the romance alive.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I like to keep it fresh. When you live together that's when she starts wearing ... she don't come with the lingerie, she come with the sweatpants and the cream on the face and the curlers and the Uggs," Marlon joked. "That says, I'm not going to give you none."</p><p>Things came to an end between the couple that year, after Marlon was spotted in the arms of a mystery woman while traveling around on a luxury boat near St. Barts. An extremely private person, Marlon approached the breakup the same way he did the relationship, sharing only a sparse few details with the press. He and Angelica have been co-parenting their kids ever since.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Marlon Wayans has written quite a few jokes about his experiences with raising kids.</h2><p>"When you're a parent, there's no proper formula. Did I spoil them? I know I should have never told the kids I had money. I should have raised them in the projects," Marlon joked in his 2021 HBO comedy special <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">You Know What It Is</a>. "They need more government cheese in their life."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a 2017 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, Marlon opened up about the complications that started to emerge once his kids became teenagers.</p><p>"I stopped being their dad a long time ago. I was like, 'We are going to be friends.' As a dad, I don't want to be all possessive, like, 'You! Who are you talking to?' and 'I want to meet him!'" he explained. "No, I want to be your friend and I'm going to walk you through it."</p><p>"At a point when they become teenagers, you have to have real conversations," he added. "What you don't want is sneaky kids. 'If you tell me what's poppin', I can protect you. But don't come to me after the fact.'"</p><p>In the same interview, he also fielded a question about his approach toward romantic relationships. "Listen, love is like water," Marlon said. "You pour it into different glasses and it takes shape."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zuM6nZLCZqZa7tHnKopus</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarlon-wayans-kids.html&text=Who%20Are%20the%20Comedian%27s%20Children%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarlon-wayans-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarlon-wayans-kids.html&title=Who%20Are%20the%20Comedian%27s%20Children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarlon-wayans-kids.html&title=Who%20Are%20the%20Comedian%27s%20Children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarlon-wayans-kids.html&title=Who%20Are%20the%20Comedian%27s%20Children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarlon-wayans-kids.html&description=Who%20Are%20the%20Comedian%27s%20Children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-mara-maravilha-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Mara Maravilha Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cardi-b-poses-nude-six-weeks-after-giving-birth-to-daughter-kulture.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cardi B Poses Nude Six Weeks After Giving Birth to Daughter Kulture">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
