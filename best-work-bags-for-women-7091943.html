When you tote around a bag for work, it needs to be durable, easy to organize, able to protect your laptop, and also have enough room to fit all your day’s essentials — and perhaps even be versatile enough to bring with you for post-work activities, whether that's a workout class or happy hour.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“One of the biggest trends I'm seeing regarding work bags is overall versatility of use,” says celebrity stylist Chelsea Volpe. “For example, many working women are using the same bag for their morning workout, office bag, and even transitioning it into their evening bag. A medium to full-size leather tote is a perfect bag to transition from the gym to the office to a happy hour cocktail with friends.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To start our search, we researched popular work bags on the market, spoke with experts, pored over reviews, and tested most of them ourselves, to ultimately align on this list of the best work bags for women.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to discover PEOPLE's picks, as well as more expert shopping advice.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hoxis-minimalist-clean-cut-pebbled-faux-leather-tote></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hoxis Minimalist Faux Leather Tote</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=hoxis-minimalist-clean-cut-pebbled-faux-leather-tote style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ROZ_ORR8uOaDRj5qTnlT8Unk8Dc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hoxis-minimalist-clean-cut-pebbled-faux-leather-tote-9bffd6a378bf4485a6ac81457363522d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a quality work bag at an affordable price, you can’t beat this option that’s available on Amazon.

This tote is perfect for the commuter who prefers to squeeze in a yoga or cycling class before heading into the office (and wants something they can tote around for weekend errands, too).

We love Quince because they offer high-quality goods (made in the same factories as some designer brands) at non-luxury prices. For example, this $90 bag would traditionally be marked up to around $200, according to the brand. Plus, it offers free shipping and 365-day returns, which is a much longer return period than most other online retailers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made from precisely 27 plastic water bottles with recycled leather trim, this bag features spacious storage so you can fit everything you need, from your 13- or 15-inch laptop to your reusable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>water bottle</a>, and so much more.

Sometimes you’re paying for the extra storage and functional bells and whistles, or you could just be paying for the brand name.</p><p>"Delivering equal measures of fashion and function, expensive work bags are often worth the indulgence: Better construction, higher end materials and thicker straps that can withstand all of the heavy goodies you stash in your bag," explains Conroy. "But sometimes expensive 'it bags' of the season miss the mark on performance. So, shop with care. Like dating, don’t fall in love with a sexy counterfeit. Make sure your roomy carryall doesn’t just look good, it meets your wish list. The bag of your dreams might cost you much less than you think."</p><p>There are plenty of other great work bags on the list that are much more affordable and still offer plenty of functionality and durability as well. "Budget-friendly work bags don’t have to be hideous," says Conroy. "Dabble with brands like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Béis</a> or Denmark’s very own <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Rains</a> to fully complete the affordable artisan experience."</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.92063492063492><p><span class=accordion__title>Do work bags need to be washable?</span></p><p>It’s not essential for work bags to be easily washable, although that’s one perk for our machine-washable pick: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Rothy’s The Lightweight Tote</a>.
