He is the only son of Lonnie Walker III and Tamica Wall.</p><p>Lonnie’s parents were very young when he was born. His father was just in his sophomore year when he became a dad. Consequently, he dropped out of work and took care of his son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lonnie-with-his-mother.jpg><p>However, his parents never legally married. Instead, they co-parented Walker with him staying in his dad’s house. He grew up in Reading and attended Reading Senior High School.</p><p>As a child, he became interested in athletic activities.</p><p>He played basketball with his friends and local boys in high school. He soon made it to the high school’s first team and led his team to many inter-school tournaments.</p><p>However, his parents did not allow him to spend all his free time in basketball. They had high regard for education, so they had a routine specifying his playtime and reading time.&nbsp;</p><p>His dad, Lonnie Sr., was a basketball player in his college days. So he was well aware that his son could make a promising professional career in basketball.</p><p>However, he wanted young Walker to become a good person, well-versed in every human quality possible.</p><p>More importantly, he wanted his son to remain aloof from the gang culture of Reading. Their hometown was quite infamous for drugs and gang fights at that time. Fortunately, he avoided bad influences and did well in sports and his studies.</p><p>After high school, he joined the University of Miami to play college basketball and continue his studies.</p><h2>Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Lonnie Walker enrolled in Reading Senior High School as a kid in Reading, Pennsylvania. He was lean and athletic since childhood, so he quickly secured his place on the varsity team.</p><p>He played around 27 games as a freshman and averaged 8 points per game. Additionally, he did very well and impressed the coaches, who recognized him as one of the school’s best athletes.</p><p>Moving onto the second year, he played some matches before missing out on the whole season due to an injury. After that, he took a long rest and eventually returned to court for his third year.</p><p>He averaged 17.1 points per game as a junior, playing 29 matches. But then, he kept improving his performance and grew much better year after year. He finished his senior year with a career-best average of 18.4 points per game.</p><p>In addition to his records, he led his team to win their first-ever state championships in 2017.</p><p>After finishing his high school career with the best results, he joined the Miami Hurricanes for his college career.</p><h3>College Career</h3><p>Lonnie played for the Miami Hurricanes as a freshman. He made his college debut against Gardner-Webb University on November 10, 2017. In his debut match, he recorded season-high five assists along with 10 points.</p><p>Similarly, he scored 12 points and five rebounds for an 80-52 win against Princeton University on December 2, 2017. He broke his previous career-high points record after scoring 26 points in a single match against Boston University in the same month.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, he recorded seven rebounds in the exact match to win with a score of 69-54.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lonnie-Walker-in-the-Miami-Hurricanes-jersey-1024x1024.jpg><p>However, he had a very brief college career. After the first season, he decided to forgo the rest of his college career and go for the 2018 NBA Draft.</p><p>He played 32 matches for the Miami Hurricanes and averaged 11.5 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Even though most people thought he did wrong going for the draft so early, he shocked everyone when the San Antonio Spurs selected him. The team picked the young college kid as the draft’s first-round 18th pick.</p><p>Following his selection, they included him in the 2018 NBA Summer League squad.</p><p>Soon after, he officially signed a contract with the Spurs on July 11, 2018. However, he did not play in the NBA regular season match for the Spurs until the beginning of 2019.</p><p>Meanwhile, he suffered a meniscus tear on October 6, 2018, and did not appear in any games until the next month. After his recovery, the shooting guard was assigned to the Austin Spurs, an affiliate team of the Spurs, for some time.</p><p>He finally made his NBA debut on January 3, 2021, against the Toronto Raptors, scoring 3 points and one rebound, playing for just five minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Lonnie-LeBron-Davis.jpg><p>He improved slightly more than in his previous season but could not perform as expected.</p><p>Walker scored a career-high 28 points, including 19 in the 4th quarter, in a 135–133 double overtime win over the Houston Rockets on&nbsp;December 3, 2019.</p><p>He signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers on July 6, 2022.</p><p>On 8 May 2019, he scored 15 points in the fourth quarter as the Lakers built a commanding lead in the Western Conference semifinals with a 104-101 victory over the visiting Warriors.</p><p><a href=#>LeBron</a> led the charge with 27 points. Meanwhile, Walker proved a vital asset for the Lakers in the fourth quarter, scoring all 15 points to help his team build a commanding lead.</p><h2>Injuries & Health Update</h2><p>Lonnie first experienced his significant injury while he was in high school.

He came out clear from Covid-19 protocols and finally became fit to join the team on January 6, 2022.</p><p>Similarly, in early February 2022, he suffered a knee injury forcing him to remain off-court for some days.</p><p>However, he returned after the first week of the same month against Cleveland.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Some of his awards & achievements include:</p><ul><li>Mr. Pennsylvania Basketball (2017)</li><li>ACC All-Freshman Team (2018)</li><li>McDonald’s All-American (2017)</li></ul><h2>Age, Weight & Height</h2><p>As of <span>2023</span>, the Lakers shooting guard is <span>25 years of age.

His small but agile body helps him dodge his opponents and move forward for more points during the games.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving onto his facial features, he has black eyes and black-colored hair. Previously, he had long hair, and when asked about it, the player remarked that he kept long hair as a coping mechanism for the trauma he endured as a child.</p><p>He was a frequent victim of sexual harassment from one of his family members.
