The husband and wife musical duo shares son <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rennie</a>, but Katharine also embraced her stepmom role effortlessly, as David shares his five other kids from previous relationships. In addition to Rennie, the full Foster blended family includes David’s daughters, <strong>Allison</strong>, <strong>Amy</strong>, <strong>Sara</strong>, <strong>Erin,</strong> and <strong>Jordan</strong>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>David opened up about how things are different now that he has a young boy. “I had all daughters until my son, and I love all my daughters immeasurably, but having a son is a little bit different,” David told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>PEOPLE</i></a> in 2023 about the newest addition to his family.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Katharine and David are very dedicated parents, but their 35-year age difference has played a part in their differences in parenting.&nbsp; David joked that his wife was “not down” with disciplining their son Rennie in a November 2023 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;Katharine explained that they just had differing ideas. “I just want to discipline in my own way. There’s the more old-fashioned way of disciplining which involves time-outs and things like that. My take is that you can have more mindful parenting opposed to just assuming that a two or three-year-old can have time alone to reflect on what they’ve done poorly,” she told the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Despite disagreeing on discipline, it’s clear that David and Katharine are a great team. They perform together often, and in October, they released a Christmas album together. The album included tons of classics like “Santa Baby”, “Jingle Bell Rock”, and much more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/david-foster-kids-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Scroll down to learn more about David’s six children.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Allison Jones</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Allison, the eldest of the Foster kids, was adopted by another family after David welcomed her when he was 20 years old. The father and daughter have not disclosed the name of her biological mother. After she was adopted, Allison reconnected with David years later and works for the David Foster Foundation as the secretary to the Board, Director, Business & Stakeholder Relations.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Amy Foster</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>David and his first wife, <b>B.J. Cook</b>, welcomed Amy in July 1973. She decided to pursue music as a career, following in her dad’s footsteps.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“When your dad is David Foster, I realized very quickly that people automatically had a lot of ideas about who I was going to be, and I needed to learn the craft of songwriting and Los Angeles was not really the place to do it,” Amy explained to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Page Six</i></a> in 2018. “So, I moved to Nashville when I was 29 and spent six or seven years, every day, writing songs and learning how to be a songwriter.”</p><h2>Sara Foster<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>David and his second wife, <b>Rebecca Dyer,</b> welcomed Sara in February 1981. After trying her hand at modeling, Sara became an actress and an entertainment personality. She worked as a host of <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>’s <i>ET on MTV</i> and appeared in several music videos, including the Backstreet Boys’ “Shape of My Heart.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>&nbsp;</p><h2>Erin Foster</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Erin is the second child of David and Rebecca. She was born in August 1982 and, like her older sister, pursued acting and on-screen roles. Among Erin’s most noteworthy gigs were on <i>CSI</i>, <i>Gilmore Girls </i>and <i>House</i>. She and Sara also teamed up to costar in VH1’s reality parody series <i>Barely Famous</i>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Jordan Foster</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Jordan was born in September 1986 and is David and Rebecca’s youngest daughter. She now works as a celebrity hairstylist in New York City and was the style director of her sisters Erin and Sara’s clothing line, “Favorite Daughter.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Rennie Foster</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>David and Katharine welcomed Rennie in February 2021. While speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>PEOPLE</i></a> in 2023, the “Wildflower” artist explained that while he is an older parent, he is hopeful that he can provide a different level of wisdom for Rennie.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“I think that I can offer one thing to Rennie even though I won’t be around when he’s 50 or 40 even, or 30 maybe,” David said. “I think I can offer him wisdom from my 72 years on the planet. And maybe that’s not a bad trade-off. I hope so.” <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OaraKcXZu8tMDEq2SappRiuKLAx5qpoqaVYrqkvMeenKxlk522rbDRnqVmpZWawW7Ax56gq2WbnrG0eZRqbWtvYW18</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-foster-and-katharine-mcphees-children-meet-their-kids-5162718.html&text=Meet%20Their%20Kids%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-foster-and-katharine-mcphees-children-meet-their-kids-5162718.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-foster-and-katharine-mcphees-children-meet-their-kids-5162718.html&title=Meet%20Their%20Kids%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-foster-and-katharine-mcphees-children-meet-their-kids-5162718.html&title=Meet%20Their%20Kids%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-foster-and-katharine-mcphees-children-meet-their-kids-5162718.html&title=Meet%20Their%20Kids%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-foster-and-katharine-mcphees-children-meet-their-kids-5162718.html&description=Meet%20Their%20Kids%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paris-berelc-age-boyfriend-parents-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paris Berelc &amp;amp; Boyfriend Show Age Doesn't Matter In Love - All Details">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./identity-marilyn-monroes-real-father-total-mystery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Identity of Marilyn Monroe's real father was a total mystery until now heres how the 100yr rid">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
