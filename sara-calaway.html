It usually refers to a physically attractive woman accompanying a wrestler.</p><p>Being a Valet gave her a lot of fame and sponsorships. However, it also drew her many stalkers, especially those who had feuds with the Undertaker.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the video of <a href=#>the Undertaker</a> and his Valet Sara making an entrance.</p><p>Sara Calaway’s most celebrated appearance in WWE is when fellow American professional wrestler Diamond Dallas Page stalked her.</p><p>He, in fact, filmed Sara without asking for her consent.

However, the grudges ended on the WWE Raw episode of August 20, 2001.</p><p>Besides, Sara Calaway was used in storylines by WWE to inculcate The Undertaker’s personal and family spheres.</p><p>Sara then vanished away for the rest of 2001.

After all, he only did it to make an impact and be “the biggest dog in the yard.”</p><p>However, Sara summoned the newcomer for a match. It came as a shock cause Sara had never fought before. Fans were not influenced; Sara could take Diamond Page down.</p><p>But with the help of her husband, Mark, Sara was able to win over her stalker.
