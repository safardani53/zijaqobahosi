On January 17, the 35-year-old posted a 28-minute YouTube video in which he claimed that conservative media conglomerates “are no better than Big Tech” firms. He captioned the video, without naming anybody, as follows:</p><p>“The folks you believed were working for you have prioritized fast riches and appeasement of their tech masters above any genuine conservative ideals.”</p><p>In the video, the media personality said how he used to believe that all of the right-wing media was “united” in their battle against Large Tech, but that many of the senior executives “in command of the big conservative platforms” are “verifiably in bed with them.”</p><p>“Massive Scam[servative] is in bed with Big Tech; a lot of it has been a big con.”</p><p>Furthermore, he displayed the contracts he had been given by the rightwing media, as well as the terms and conditions for reducing his remuneration if they were not satisfied.&nbsp;At first glance, one may believe Steven Crowder is referring to Fox Media, which is similarly conservative, but it is The Daily Wire, which is valued at approximately $150 million and is looking to grow by developing movies and media for youngsters with a small viewership.</p><h2>How much money does Steven Crowder have in comparison to The Daily Wire?</h2><p>Crowder’s net worth is reported to be $4 million, which he has amassed over the years via his daily podcast and YouTube channel Louder with Crowder.&nbsp;In terms of The Daily Wire, Axios stated in February 2022 that the conservative media outlet is valued at $100 million. Forbes estimated its net value to be $150 million in April of the same year, with 200 full-time workers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Steven-Crowder-1.jpg alt="Steven Crowder" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On January 18, The Daily Wire’s Co-CEO, Jeremy Boreing, posted a video on the organization’s YouTube channel in which he addressed Steven Crowder’s offers and claims and acknowledged that the latter was actually speaking about his business.&nbsp;Boreing said in a 52-minute video that Steven Crowder is “one of the best performers in the nation,” but finds it disrespectful that he pretends to be the sole person behind his success despite the fact that he is constantly financed by billionaires and major corporations.</p><p>“Steven, in my opinion, is one of the most gifted conservative performers. However, Steven was never required to establish the firm that distributes, advertises, and monetizes all of that material.”</p><p>He then pointed out the parts of Crowder’s video that he found objectionable.&nbsp;“Steven has always worked for someone else and been compensated by someone else. But it doesn’t mean he should let others tell him what to say. However, he is not a self-made guy. When I met him, he was paid by PJ TV, which was owned by a billionaire at the time. He was then owned for a period of years by CRTV, which was controlled by a billionaire at the time.”</p><p>He added that Steven Crowder generated “a ton of income” from all of his ventures, adding that he did not have to develop all of it and “did not have to worry about it:”</p><p>“He didn’t have to be lucrative, and he doesn’t know for sure whether he was or not since, as he said, all of those firms didn’t disclose information about what was going on with them. So Steven is positive that his presentation was lucrative, but he has no idea.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Steven-Crowder-2.jpg alt="Steven Crowder" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the same video, a picture of Crowder’s contract was shown, which stated that his price would be “$50 million for the original period, plus $25 million if the renewal term is extended.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmarpJrDprqMnKmor5Sav266xK1ksKeiqbVur8CrnJ6qXaiura3RsmY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-rich-is-steven-crowder-net-worth-career-salary.html&text=How%20Rich%20Is%20Steven%20Crowder%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Salary&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-rich-is-steven-crowder-net-worth-career-salary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-rich-is-steven-crowder-net-worth-career-salary.html&title=How%20Rich%20Is%20Steven%20Crowder%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-rich-is-steven-crowder-net-worth-career-salary.html&title=How%20Rich%20Is%20Steven%20Crowder%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-rich-is-steven-crowder-net-worth-career-salary.html&title=How%20Rich%20Is%20Steven%20Crowder%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-rich-is-steven-crowder-net-worth-career-salary.html&description=How%20Rich%20Is%20Steven%20Crowder%3f%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-was-pen15-canceled.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Hulu's Hit Cringe Comedy Series 'Pen15' Being Prematurely Canceled?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cassi-davis-husband-family-married-wedding-net-worth-kids-weight-loss-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Cassi Davis Get Married?
