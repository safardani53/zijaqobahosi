On April 28, 2016, he was also selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round with the fourth overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. And, leading up to the 2016 NFL season, he was widely regarded as an early favorite for the 2016 Offensive Rookie of the Year while playing behind what many agreed was the NFL’s most dominant offensive line. Then, in May 2016, he signed a four-year rookie contract with the team.</p><p>Similarly, after the ninth game of the 2016 season, he became the Cowboys’ second rookie to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season. He even became the third running back in history to rush for 1,000 yards. He finished his rookie season as the NFL’s leading rusher and the youngest player to reach 1,600 yards.</p><p>As a result of his successful season, he was named First-Team All-Pro and qualified for his first Pro Bowl. Elliott was suspended due to allegations that he was abusive to his girlfriend. He decided to accept the suspension and leave the country for a short period of time to train. He then returned in Week 16 against the Seattle Seahawks in a must-win situation, rushing for 97 yards on 24 carries.</p><p>In 15 games and starts, Ezekiel Elliott finished the 2018 season with 1,434 rushing yards and six touchdowns, as well as 77 receptions for 567 yards and three touchdowns. He also won the rushing title for the second time in three years.</p><p>Then, on September 4, he agreed to terms with the Cowboys on a six-year extension worth $90 million, with $50 million guaranteed, keeping him under contract through the 2026 season. In addition, he finished the 2019 season with 1,357 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns, as well as 54 receptions for 420 yards and two touchdowns in 15 games and starts.</p><p>Ezekiel finished the 2020 season with 979 rushing yards and six touchdowns, as well as 52 receptions for 338 yards and two touchdowns. Elliott’s contract was then restructured by the Cowboys on August 27, 2021. To save salary-cap space, he converted $8.6 million of his base salary for the upcoming season into a signing bonus.</p><h2>Ezekiel Elliott Girlfriend, Dating</h2><p>Halle Woodard is Ezekiel Elliott’s girlfriend. However, the couple has kept their relationship a closely guarded secret. And, of course, as much as possible away from the media and public eye. And we only found out about their relationship because Elliott’s mother posted pictures of them.</p><h2>Ezekiel Elliott’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong> has a net worth of $12 million, as of November 2023, and his primary source of income must be his football career.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGics52bnrKtecSlo6KnpKl8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fezekiel-elliott.html&text=Ezekiel%20Elliott-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fezekiel-elliott.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fezekiel-elliott.html&title=Ezekiel%20Elliott-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fezekiel-elliott.html&title=Ezekiel%20Elliott-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fezekiel-elliott.html&title=Ezekiel%20Elliott-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fezekiel-elliott.html&description=Ezekiel%20Elliott-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./katie-nageotte.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Katie Nageotte net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chuck-berry.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chuck Berry Celebrity Profile  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
