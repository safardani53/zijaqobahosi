On his social media profile, the comic expressed his displeasure about being hospitalized again.

He said that the previous night, he played in front of a large audience at Madison Square Garden as part of his Wild ‚ÄòN Out tour.&nbsp;Other musicians on the Wild ‚ÄòN Out tour included Rip Micheals, Michael Blackson, Emmanuel Hudson, Hitman Holla, A Boogie Wit da Hoodie, DJ D-Wrek, and more.&nbsp;When fans learned that Cannon was in the hospital, they flocked to social media to wish him a speedy recovery and to give their good wishes.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Nick Cannon rushed to hospital with pneumonia hours after performing at sold out show</p><p>So he preformed a sold out show, maskless, obviously sick ‚Ä¶ ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/cmCKjvmvAq</a></p><p>‚Äî Jess (@MeetJess) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">December 3, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>This story isn‚Äôt even about me but isn‚Äôt it heartwarming how everyone is so concerned about this sick performer and no one at all is concerned about the sold out Madison Square Garden crowd he superspread whatever-he-has to?

The actor had to undergo treatment for a pulmonary embolism in February 2012. The next year, he was sent to the hospital for minor renal failure. His publicist indicated at the time that he and his wife Mariah Carey were on vacation in Aspen, Colorado. Carey subsequently posted a photo of Cannon on her website, sitting alongside him in the hospital bed, and asked for everyone‚Äôs well wishes for him.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Nick-Cannon-2.jpg alt="Nick Cannon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He later revealed on Good Morning America that he suffers from lupus nephritis, which has a negative impact on his kidneys. He continued,</p><p>‚ÄúThey thought it was just a kidney disease, and then they tried to figure out why my immune system was attacking my kidneys, and that was the root of it all.‚Äù</p><p>Cannon‚Äôs doctors once advised him to reduce his workload because it was affecting his health. Despite taking a vacation from work, things did not improve, and his blood clots were connected to his renal issues, according to his physicians.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Nick-Cannon.jpg alt="Nick Cannon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Nick Cannon and Alyssa Scott are expecting their second child.</h2><p>Nick Cannon and Alyssa Scott are expecting their second child early next year. Zen, the couple‚Äôs first child, was born in June of last year but died five months later from a brain tumor. Scott also confirmed the news a few days ago in a social media post that included a photoshoot in which she flaunted her baby bump.&nbsp;Cannon is the father of 12 children, whom he shares with Mariah Carey, Brittany Bell, Abby De La Rosa, and LaNisha Cole. Nick is well-known for his appearances on television series such as The Masked Singer, The Nick Cannon Show, and America‚Äôs Got Talent.
