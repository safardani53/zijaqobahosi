Bader Is A Banking Whiz</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Bader Shammas is a financier who serves as the assistant vice president at Credit Suisse, an international wealth management company based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He previously worked as an associate at BNP Paribas Wealth Management up until 2017, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elle</a>. He does have an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram account</a>, which Lindsay notably tags in some of her posts, however, it is private.</p><h2>2. He Attended College In America</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Before he settled in Dubai, Bader earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of South Florida in 2010, according to Elle. Two years later, he received a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree while attending John H. Sykes College of Business, which is affiliated with the University of Tampa. He also had his educational background listed on his now-deleted LinkedIn page, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/lindsay-lohan-engaged-fiance-Bader-Shammas-ss-post.jpg><h2>3. Bader Has Been Dating Lindsay For Two Years</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Although the young couple have kept their relationship <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>relatively private</a>, it was reported the pair had been seeing each other for almost two years prior to their engagement. “Lindsay’s relationship with Bader is going strong,” a source told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun </a>. “She has been with him for about two years now.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>More recently, on Nov. 10, 2022, the red haired beauty spoke with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jimmy Fallon</a>&nbsp;</strong>on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Tonight Show</a>&nbsp;to chat about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her marriage</a> and latest work. “It’s great. It’s amazing. I met my person,” she revealed. “You never know if you’re going to find that in life, and he’s an amazing guy, man, and I love him, and we’re a great team,” she said. “You just get to share everything with someone, and it’s so special. Everything becomes that much more important.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-17>The&nbsp;Herbie: Fully Loaded&nbsp;actress even made an appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Drew Barrymore Show&nbsp;</a>on Nov. 14, 2022, to promote&nbsp;Falling for Christmas. During her chat with&nbsp;<strong>Ross Mathews&nbsp;</strong>Lindsay opened up a bit about <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>having kids</a> with Bader. “People ask me all the time, ‘Ross when are you going to have a kid?’, it’s annoying right?”, the 43-year-old told Lindsay. The starlet revealed that many of her mom friends are asking her the same question. “Of course I want kids in the future,” she declared. She also revealed that spending time her with niece does give her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby fever</a>.</p><h2>4. They had their honeymoon on the Turkish Riviera</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>After the couple tied the knot, Bader and Lindsay decided to celebrate with a gorgeous vacation to the Turkish Riviera in July.

She shared a few different <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shots</a> of herself lounging in the sun at the beautiful resort, and it’s clear the couple had a blast!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bader-Shammas-5-Things-BG-embed.jpg><h2>5. The Lohans All Seem To Approve Of Him</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Before the pair tied the knot, Bader started bonding with Lindsay’s family. In February 2020, Lindsay shared a snap of herself with a group of friends at a music festival in Dubai. The picture featured her sister, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ali Lohan</strong></a>, Bader, and members of the rock band Bastille. In the since-deleted post, per Elle, Lindsay originally wrote, “@aliana lovely night with sister and my boyfriend bader such a magical night.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michael Lohan</strong></a> appears ready to walk Lindsay down the aisle into the arms of Bader! “Based on what has been released by Lindsay so far, all I’ll say is that I’m so happy for her and Balor, and proud of all she’s doing in life,” the proud papa EXCLUSIVELY told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife. </strong>“God Bless them.” Even her younger brother, <strong>Dakota</strong>, approves of the engagement, as he commented on Lindsay’s Instagram announcement, “My best friends!!!” Since news of the wedding broke, it’s unclear who in her family was in attendance.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>Before Lindsay and Bader tied the knot, the actress’s mom&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dina Lohan</a>&nbsp;</strong>also showed that she’d given the financier her stamp of approval. She called him a “wonderful guy” in a 2020 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>.&nbsp;When Lindsay shared a New Year’s Eve post in December 2021, her mom also reshared the post on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story and showed love to her daughter and future son-in-law. “My heart is full. #engaged #newbeginnings,” she wrote at the time, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KvorDEq2SsoJGiuqK%2FjG1scXFoZYVw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-bader-shammas-4589808.html&text=Who%20Is%20Bader%20Shammas%3f%20Facts%20About%20Lindsay%20Lohans%20Husband%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-bader-shammas-4589808.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-bader-shammas-4589808.html&title=Who%20Is%20Bader%20Shammas%3f%20Facts%20About%20Lindsay%20Lohans%20Husband%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-bader-shammas-4589808.html&title=Who%20Is%20Bader%20Shammas%3f%20Facts%20About%20Lindsay%20Lohans%20Husband%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-bader-shammas-4589808.html&title=Who%20Is%20Bader%20Shammas%3f%20Facts%20About%20Lindsay%20Lohans%20Husband%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-bader-shammas-4589808.html&description=Who%20Is%20Bader%20Shammas%3f%20Facts%20About%20Lindsay%20Lohans%20Husband%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amber-portwood-reacts-to-ex-fiance-matt-baiers-surprise-marriage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amber Portwood Reacts to Ex-Fiance Matt Baiers Surprise Marriage">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sofia-vergara-blue-animal-print-bikini-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sofia Vergara Rocks Blue Animal Print Bikini As She Says Bye To Summer  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
