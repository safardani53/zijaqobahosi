The name was a favorite of the couple's and made perfect sense as Victoria explained she was in New York City when she discovered she was pregnant. Brooklyn's parents later named <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Elton John</a> as his godfather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brooklyn spent much of his childhood <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>in rural Oxfordshire</a>, although his father's career as a soccer star also took the family to Madrid and Los Angeles. Growing up, he attended both the Curtis School as well as Willows Community School as a junior high schooler. His parents attempted to keep him out of the spotlight as much as possible and encouraged him to do normal things alongside his non-famous peers. In fact, Brooklyn even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>held a job at a local café</a> in order to earn pocket money.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a teenager, Brooklyn considered following in David's footsteps and joined the Arsenal FC Academy. Although he had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>played soccer almost his entire life</a> to that point, he decided it wasn't the career path he wanted to pursue and was eventually <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dropped by the youth team</a> before he turned 16 years old.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of soccer, Brooklyn dabbled in modeling, making his debut on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the cover of Man About Town magazine</a>. He went on to appear on the cover of Vogue China and Miss Vogue as well as British Vogue with his mother and siblings. He also appeared in publications like Interview and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dazed Korea</a> — and even landed campaigns with brands including Superdry and Huawei.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While modeling, Brooklyn also fell in love with photography. He studied the subject in school and after, "straight away" knowing it was something he was interested in. He was given the opportunity to hone his skills in the real world; he regularly shot photos backstage at his mom's fashion shows and landed a gig shooting an ad campaign for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Burberry's Brit fragrance</a>. Brooklyn even scored an internship with famed British fashion photographer David Sims.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When he was just 18, Brooklyn released his first photography book, What I See, which shared a series of snapshots from his life, with each chapter telling a different story through his photos. Brooklyn's love of photography <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>led him to Parsons School of Design</a> in N.Y.C., although he only stayed at the college for a year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a young adult, Brooklyn has made headlines for his high-profile romances, like his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>on-and-off relationship</a> with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Chloë Grace Moretz</a>, before ultimately finding lasting love with his now-wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Nicola Peltz</a>. After they began dating in October 2019, they went public with their relationship the following January. Just six months later, they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>were engaged</a> and eventually <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>tied the knot in an extravagant ceremony</a> in April 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October of that year, Victoria reflected on her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>son's wedding day</a>. "It was a beautiful wedding," she said. "As a mother, to see my son so happy means so much. What more can you ask for?" The designer added that raising older children is all about "cherishing every moment."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Victoria Beckham Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nowadays, Brooklyn's primary focus is on cooking. Early in the pandemic, he started making meals every day to pass the time — and he hasn't stopped since then. Nicola encouraged him to share his cooking adventures online and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eventually began filming him</a>. His <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>social media posts</a> in the kitchen soon turned into his own Facebook Watch show, Cookin' with Brooklyn. While he said he enjoyed his photography and modeling career, cooking has become his true passion and he hopes to one day have a few of his own TV shows and open a pub in L.A.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I really enjoyed [photography] for a couple of years. I love taking pictures of my wife. I still have all my film cameras, but now it's just more of a fun thing to do. They were kind of all hobbies. I was still trying to find that one thing I would literally die for, and I found that with cooking," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Brooklyn shared with Variety</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-romeo-james-beckham-21></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Romeo James Beckham, 21</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dominique Charriau/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Sept. 1, 2002, David and Victoria welcomed their second child, Romeo James Beckham. Like his big brother, the little boy was born at Portland Hospital in London. Following his birth, David shared that they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>chose Romeo's moniker</a> because "it's just a name we love." He also noted that the infant already had "Brooklyn's nose and Victoria's chin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a toddler, Romeo experienced some health issues that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>put him in the hospital</a> on numerous occasions. Victoria eventually shared that Romeo had been diagnosed with epilepsy, a condition that causes seizures and convulsions. After the revelation, paparazzi agreed to refrain from photographing the little boy as the constant flashing could trigger a seizure.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Romeo Beckham Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Romeo went on to attend private schools in London while growing up. He even made his modeling debut as a child, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>starring in a campaign for Burberry Kids</a> at just 10 years old. As a teen, he landed his first cover, appearing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>on the front of L'Uomo Vogue</a>'s Generation Issue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to modeling, Romeo also decided to follow in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in soccer. Like Brooklyn, he joined Arsenal FC Academy but ultimately stepped away when he was 13. He briefly put his soccer dreams aside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>in favor of playing tennis</a>, training <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>four to five days a week</a> and even getting the chance to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>play alongside professionals</a> like Andy Murray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just a few years later, Romeo decided to give soccer another try, and at 19, he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>joined Fort Lauderdale CF</a>, the sister club of Inter Miami CF, which is co-owned by his dad. The team competes in League One of the United Soccer League and in September 2021, he made his professional debut in a match against Tormenta FC.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Rosenblum/Icon Sportswire</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite his busy schedule filled with athletics and modeling, Romeo managed to make time for romance. Romeo was most recently linked to model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mia Regan</a>, whom he reportedly began dating in 2019. The couple made their first joint red carpet appearance at the 2021 British Fashion Awards.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Victoria Beckham/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2023, Romeo celebrated his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>21st birthday</a> with his parents and Regan.

Following Cruz's birth, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>David shared that the little boy</a> was "beautiful" and "very happy" to be surrounded by his two big brothers. When it came time to name him, David admitted that it was "hard this time," but the couple came up with a name that they both loved and "stuck to it."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Denis Doyle/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Cruz was born in Spain while his dad was playing with Real Madrid, he moved to L.A. with his family when David began playing soccer with L.A. Galaxy. He quickly proved he was meant to be in the spotlight when he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>took the stage with the Spice Girls</a> at age 3.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Cruz was 11, he announced he would be following in his mom's footsteps with his first foray into music.

He even recruited his family to be a part of the music video. Since then, he's picked up skills on the guitar, mandolin <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>and piano</a> — and has also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>learned to record his own music</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>cruz beckham/ instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cruz has also modeled, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>landing his first magazine cover</a> in 2022.

He's worked with numerous producers, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Poo Bear</a>, and is set on "just making the music" he loves that chronicles "personal" and "real experiences."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't think you ever stop learning, but I'm taking my time seeing what happens," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he told i-D magazine</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2023, Victoria and David <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated Cruz's 18th birthday</a>. They each shared the same tribute — a montage of photos and videos from throughout Cruz's life — on their respective Instagram accounts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Happy 18th Birthday to our baby boy ❤️ to the most amazing boy with the most amazing energy and the biggest heart x we are so proud of you and we love you so much Cruzie ❤️," the soccer star captioned his post, while Victoria wrote: "Happy Birthday Cruzie!!

Happy 18th superstar."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few months later, Cruz paid tribute to his mother by getting Victoria's Spice Girls moniker, "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Posh</a>," tattooed on his right arm.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-harper-seven-beckham-12></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Harper Seven Beckham, 12</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Beckham Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On July 10, 2011, Victoria and David <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>welcomed Harper Seven Beckham</a> at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in L.A. David later revealed that the couple loved that Harper is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>an old English name</a> and appreciated its connection to the author of To Kill a Mockingbird, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Harper Lee</a>. He noted that Seven was also a special name, symbolizing spiritual perfection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The main reason behind Seven was it symbolizes spiritual perfection — the seven wonders of the world, the seven colors of the rainbow — and in many cultures it is a lucky number. We love the name and we love Harper Seven. We are very happy to have her in our lives and in our family, and it is an amazing time for our family right now," David said in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Facebook video</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As she's grown up, David and Victoria have shared plenty of photos and videos of their little girl, who appears to have a wide range of interests outside of school. From <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>playing soccer with her dad</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>horseback riding</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>training for judo</a>, she seems to be excited to try as many extracurricular activities as she can.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Victoria Beckham Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Harper's main focus right now is getting good grades and having fun, it doesn't sound like she has plans to follow in her mom's popstar footsteps. Even though she's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>totally mastered the Posh Spice pose</a>, she's not a big fan of the glitz and glam. Victoria said Harper isn't one of the kids "who are going out with a full face of make-up and a crop top." In fact, Harper actually <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>thinks some of the outfits Victoria wore</a> in her popstar days were inappropriate!</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Victoria Beckham Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although the couple have shared lots of snaps of Harper, they've tried to protect their daughter from the spotlight as much as possible. Victoria explained that she's nervous for Harper to join social media one day, as she knows how cruel people can be online.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As of right now, Victoria said she's making sure she's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>always checking in</a> with Harper about her emotions and is ensuring she's surrounded by good people. She's "at that age where her body is going to start changing, but it's about making sure that we communicate a lot as a family and she surrounds herself with nice friends," Victoria shared in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Vogue Australia</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two of those nice friends just happen to be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Drew Barrymore</a>'s daughters, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Frankie and Olive</a>.
