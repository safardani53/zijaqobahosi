Born in London, England, she holds British nationality.</p><p>Manon McCrory is currently a 17-year-old girl pursuing her higher education. Probably, she is going to enter the acting industry and will achieve things like her late mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life_of_Manon_McCrory-Lewis></span><strong>Early Life of Manon McCrory-Lewis</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Manon McCrory-Lewis was born on 6 September 2006 in London, England, United Kingdom.</p><p>Her father, Damian Lewis is a renowned English actor, presenter, and producer, while her mother, Helen McCrory was a successful English actress.</p><p>Manon is a Welsh name that she got after her maternal grandmother was from Welsh. On the other hand, her grandfather was a Glaswegian diplomat.</p><p>Similarly, his great-great paternal grandparents were also Welsh. Moreover, her great-grandfather and Damian’s maternal grandfather was Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Ian Bowater, Lord Mayor of London.</p><p>With these data, we can say that Manon’s family is not successful in this generation, but in the past many.</p><p>Obviously, her parents are popular across the world, but her grandparents and so back people were also not less than them.</p><p>In fact, some of her ancestors were doctors to the Royal Family, a philanthropist, and naval shipbuilders. Now, talking about Manon, she grew up in Sudbury, England enjoying her life with her beloved parents.</p><p>Manon attended St Christopher’s School in Belsize Park in North London.</p><p>In March 2013, there was some work going on right after her school which became a disturbance for them and an obstacle.</p><p>Looking at this, her father came in their support with a campaign to stop building works next to his daughter’s school.</p><p>This is the live proof of Damian for his daughter.</p><p>Moreover, Manon has also a brother named Gulliver Lewis who was born on 2 November 2007, a difference of 14 Months from Manon’s age.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Manon_McCrory-Lewis_Career></span><strong>Manon McCrory-Lewis Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Manon McCrory-Lewis is currently just 17 years old and still not involved in any kind of profession. Our assumption says that she is doing her studies right now, without focusing on something else.</p><p>Manon is a star kid and thereby she will have always the advantage of becoming a star without making huge efforts from the beginning.</p><p>Of course, she will need to accumulate a lot of acting skills, if she wants to follow in her parent’s footsteps and to become an actress. But ultimately, things will be easier for her than an average person entering in this industry.</p><p>Manon McCrory has a bright future and seems she will choose acting instead of anything.</p><p>As her mother is also no more in this world, at least for her, she will love in the acting industry and will make her moments memorable.</p><p>Aside from these all, we came to the fact that Halen didn’t allow Manon and Gulliver to use technologies. Once she forbade the two siblings from overusing technology as she feared they would be unable to express themselves.</p><p>During 2015, they were even not allowed to use their computers throughout the week and had to use them for just ten minutes on weekends.</p><p>Ultimately, Helen wanted them to stay away from the internet as it will make your life in a different world with different thoughts.</p><p>Instead,, she wanted them to be professional and able to communicate with anyone like a gentleman and gentlewoman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Manon_McCrory-Lewis_Parents></span><strong>Manon McCrory-Lewis Parent’s</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Manon McCrory-Lewis was born to a very successful family as her father and mother, both are renowned icons in the world.</p><p>Manon’s father Damian Watcyn Lewis was born on 11 February 1971 to his parents and Manon’s paternal grandparents Charlotte Mary and John Watcyn Lewis.</p><p>He did his studies at the <a href=#>Guildhall School of Music and Drama</a> and learned acting there. This made him become a professional actor and earned fame across the world.</p><p>In the other hand, Manon’s mother, Helen Elizabeth McCrory was born on 19 August 1968 in Paddington, London to her father Ian McCrory, and mother Ann McCrory.</p><p>Sadly, Manon’s mother is no any more alive in this world as she passed away on 16 April 2021 in Tufnell Park, London due to breast cancer.</p><p>Manon has got two titles, McCrory and Lewis and now you would be clear how and from where she has got those two titles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Manon_McCrory-Lewis_Parents_Relationship></span><strong>Manon McCrory-Lewis Parent’s Relationship</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Manon McCrory-Lewis’s Parents Damian and Helen got married in 2007 in a low-key Kensington and Chelsea registry office in a private ceremony. Only their closest friends and family members were there to attend their marriage.</p><p>The couple first in 2003 during their shoot in the production of Five Golden Rings together at London’s Almeida Theatre. At that time, Damian used to make the laugh that attracted her to him.</p><p>Later, that friendship converted in something more, called love and they eventually decided to tie the knot.</p><p>Although, before her marriage, she was already pregnant with Manon.</p><p>Thus, she decided to marry him after giving birth to her first child, born in September 2006 and named Manon McCrory-Lewis.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Manon_McCrory-Lewis_Net_Worth></span><strong>Manon McCrory-Lewis Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Manon McCrory-Lewis is still a teenager and thus she would not have her own income or wealth.</p><p>However, being the daughter of two great celebrities, she has the potential to enjoy a luxurious life.</p><p>Even, if she wanted, she can become a millionaire by asking her dad to give her a portion. Well! Just kidding. She is not going to do that.</p><p>Manon is enough happy with her family to enjoy her life. But if we talk about her father’s net worth, it would be over $25 million as of the year 2023.</p><p>And her mother would have the same fortune, that she might have left for her family, before leaving this world.</p><p>Well! This was all about the daughter of famous actors Dalmia Lewis and Helen McCrory.
