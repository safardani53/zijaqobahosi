A victim was still alive.</p><p>“They tried to resuscitate them, the ambulance, the police - they tried to bend the door to get in there.</p><p>“It took half-an-hour to smash the window and get them out - and more police came - they really tried their best.</p><p>“They were drips and everything, but they just couldn’t save them.</p><p>"Their whole car was a mess. The front was gone.</p><p>“I feel sorry for the couple. When I looked through the passenger door she had a walking stick between her legs."</p><p>He said the Transit driver - a white man of no more than 35 - "slumped" on the ground and sat on the road as he was quizzed by police.</p><p>The Citroen ran into Mahmut's parked Honda Jazz, and the van ended up on a driveway facing out into the road.</p><p>Another neighbour said: "I heard this almighty smash and I was out of my chair to the door.</p><p>“The police were getting the crash driver out of the van and they got him on the floor - they put a blanket on him.</p><p>“The car was crumpled and you could smell the petrol.</p><p>“One officer began screaming ‘get her out, get her out’. The woman was stuck in the passenger side.</p><p>“But they got the man out and started resuscitating him straight away.</p><p>“In the end there were people everywhere, it was just chaos. All hell broke loose."</p><h2>WATCHDOG PROBE</h2><p>Council staff were busy this morning putting down sand on the 30mph street, where tyre marks could be seen across the carriageway and on a grass bank next to a damaged wooden post.</p><p>Shocked residents have laid flowers. One bunch had a note saying: “I’m so sorry, I tried to help, but it was too late. Rest in peace."</p><p>Hussein Dervish, 65, said: "I was in the back of my house when I heard just a loud bang.</p><p>"Even with the double glazing and all that, I still heard it.</p><p>"I went outside and saw the car and the van. I said to the police officer: 'I hope they are OK?' But the policeman said they weren't."</p><p>Another resident said: “The front of the car was crushed.</p><p>“If they were in the front seat they didn’t stand a chance."</p><p>Police said: "Despite the efforts of emergency services, the male and female occupants of the car, both believed to be aged in their 70s, were pronounced deceased at the scene.</p><p>"Their next of kin have been informed."</p><p>The van driver was arrested and taken to hospital with "non life-threatening" injuries.</p><p>Scotland Yard referred the case to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, a national watchdog which examines deaths following contact with officers.</p><p>Deputy Met Commissioner Sir Stephen House said: "Whilst this collision and the circumstances surrounding it will be investigated, I, on behalf of the Metropolitan Police Service, extend sincere condolences to the family and friends of the two people who died as a result of this incident.</p><p>"Our thoughts are with them at this time.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>The IOPC said: "Our investigators have attended the scene and post incident procedures to gather the initial evidence.</p><p>"Our investigation will focus on the police’s actions prior to the crash.</p><p>"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased and all those affected by this incident.</p><p>"We will make contact with the family at the appropriate point to explain our role."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000471213958.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000471196319.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000471201552.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000471196289.jpg><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
