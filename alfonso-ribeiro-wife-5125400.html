He looked like he was having a blast at his new gig. “This is just what&nbsp;@juleshough&nbsp;and I do behind the scenes at&nbsp;#DWTS,” he wrote in the caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Besides being a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>beloved host, TV star</a> and actor, Alfonso, 52, is also a loving dad and husband.

Angela joked that she called him a “stalker” after they first met in a 2018 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yahoo</a>.&nbsp;She said when they first made the date, she made the reservation and planned to leave early to see the new episode of&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy.&nbsp;“I didn’t know who he was at the time. He told me he was a director, which you were. And I was very much in the ‘I don’t want to date anyone in entertainment,'” she told Yahoo. “I don’t think it was more than 10 minutes that went by, and I was like, huh, he’s different than I thought.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>A year later, the couple exchanged vows in October 2012 in a ceremony in California. After they got married, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Alfonso</a> shared his excitement on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>. “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Last night I got married to the most incredible woman in the world,” he wrote, tagging her.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Angela Unkrich Regularly Gives Parenting Tips on Social Media</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>While Angela has mostly stayed out of the spotlight, she has put her focus on helping other parents. She used to run the now-defunct blog&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>My Mommyhood Tales</a>,&nbsp;where she opened up about her adventures as a parent. The “About” section of her blog details her upbringing in rural Iowa and playing sports, including getting a diving scholarship to Northwestern University, where she received a BA in communications. Before the blog, she worked as a screenwriter’s assistant, diving coach, and private jet flight attendant.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>While she hasn’t updated the blog since 2019, Angela still regularly posts short clips on her Instagram, where she speaks about her life as a mom. She often shares updates on their three kids, and glimpses at things like her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>flight routine</a> or how to make your <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter feel like a princess.&nbsp;</a></p><h2>How Many Kids Do Alfonso Ribeiro and Angela Unkrich Have?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>As one could probably guess from Angela’s blog content, she and Alfonso have three children together. They have sons <strong>Alfonso Jr. “AJ,”&nbsp;</strong>9, and&nbsp;<strong>Anders Reyn,&nbsp;</strong>8. They also have a daughter&nbsp;<strong>Ava Sue,&nbsp;</strong>4. Angela is also a loving stepmom to Alfonso’s oldest daughter&nbsp;<strong>Sienna,&nbsp;</strong>20, from his previous relationship. Ava did have a mishap with a scooter in May 2023. Angela shared a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> announcing her accident on Instagram. Over a month later, Angela revealed her daughter was “doing good,” and shared some of the products they were using to help her scars recover, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>In the “About” section of her blog, Angela spoke about how parenthood was one of the most important things to her. “Motherhood has certainly been one of God’s greatest gifts in my life, as well as my favorite adventure. I’ve always held a great deal of reverence and respect for mothers, but since becoming a mom myself, my level of respect has increased by leaps and bounds,” she wrote.</p><h2>Alfonso Robeiro’s Relationship With Robin Stapler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Alfonso-Ribeiro-Wife-Evergreen-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Before he met Angela, Alfonso was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married once before</a> to&nbsp;<strong>Robin Stapler&nbsp;</strong>from 2002 to 2006. Robin is also an actress, who has appeared in various TV projects over the years. Her longest run on a show was appearing in five episodes of the series In The House, which Alfonso was a star of. As mentioned above, Alfonso and Robin share an adult daughter Sienna.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Clnaimo6R6s7XBnqCrp12stqexjG5oa21kZX1w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falfonso-ribeiro-wife-5125400.html&text=All%20About%20His%20Marriage%20to%20Angela%20Unkrich%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falfonso-ribeiro-wife-5125400.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falfonso-ribeiro-wife-5125400.html&title=All%20About%20His%20Marriage%20to%20Angela%20Unkrich%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falfonso-ribeiro-wife-5125400.html&title=All%20About%20His%20Marriage%20to%20Angela%20Unkrich%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falfonso-ribeiro-wife-5125400.html&title=All%20About%20His%20Marriage%20to%20Angela%20Unkrich%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falfonso-ribeiro-wife-5125400.html&description=All%20About%20His%20Marriage%20to%20Angela%20Unkrich%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alyssa-carswell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alyssa Carswell">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-tom-burlinson-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Tom Burlinson Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
