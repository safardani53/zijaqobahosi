She then toured internationally and even appeared on Australian and New Zealand's television programs.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Her 2018 game-changing comedy-special Nannette has been widely appreciated by the critics worldwide.</p><p><strong>Official Trailer:</strong> Australian comic Hannah Gadsby features on her stand-up shows compiled 2018 NetFlix special trailer, Nanette&nbsp;(Published on 11 July 2018) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hannah Gadsby began her career working as a cinema projectionist and as a tree planter on a farm. As laid-back as she was, she couldn't make a grand career out of tree planting, that's when fate came to her rescue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Inspiring Topic:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Cancer Victim Julia Baird Savors Married Life With Husband & Children, Facts!</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h3><strong>Nannette (2018): Voice For LGBTIQ+ In Comedy&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Amidst escalating Me Too movement, on 19 June 2018, Hannah came up with a one-hour-long controversial NetFlix comedy special called Nanette, bashing self-depreciating comedy at the same time retrospecting her tragic coming out journey, just only to proclaim she would escape the industry she felt was shaped by white men 'self-depreciating' comedy failing to cover the voices of minorities.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>People believe that this piece of comedy is not a typical game changer but a compelling comedy&nbsp;masterpiece that plants desire in everyone to change their perception towards comedy as a whole. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The show brought an overwhelming&nbsp;worldview sense to those who had never seen something so inexplicable and&nbsp;so close to the artist's heart in comedy.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Hannah was born and brought up in Smithton, Tasmania as the youngest of five children. She went to Smithton High School from 1990 to 1995.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The&nbsp;Australian National University&nbsp;alum graduated&nbsp;with a Bachelor of Arts degree&nbsp;in Art History and&nbsp;Curatorship in 2003. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Growing up as a lesbian in a conservative community in Tasmania in the 80's and 90's, Gadsby subjugated inner curiosities regarding her sexuality - to stay under the norm of the place. Back then, she knew 'more facts about unicorns than'&nbsp; she did 'about lesbians.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The genius comedian relates her topsy-turvy coming out process in her comedy special Nannette, in which she also epitomizes the flaws of mainstream comedy that ruthlessly extracts humor out of the sufferings of people.</p><p>Doing so,&nbsp; she comes out as a fierce critique of famous personalities allegedly involved in&nbsp;misogyny and women objectification.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While critiquing the likes of Louis CK, Harvey Weinstein, Bill Clinton, and Pablo Picasso, for their inherent sexism, she makes her audience to think about why we shouldn't differentiate art and artists.

Her debut book is titled&nbsp;Ten Steps to Nanette.&nbsp;</p><p>It will be released sometime in 2019 in Australia through publisher Allen & Unwin while&nbsp;Random House imprint&nbsp;Ballantine purchased publishing rights.</p><p>Though there is no official date for its release outside of Australia, her loyal fans will be eagerly and desperately waiting.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The original publication date for&nbsp;Ten Steps&nbsp;had been slated for June 2018, however, was pushed back.

She didn't expect the suggestions from her friends as she was only 'entertaining a friend or annoying them' with her broken wrist and Australian charm in the hospital.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hannah Gadsby's Bio: Comedy Helps Hannah Gain Success</strong></h3><p>Upon joining comedy, Hannah&nbsp;rose to fame at the age of 28 after winning the final of Triple J's Raw Comedy Competition in 2006.

In her Twitter post of&nbsp; 9 February&nbsp;2017, she humorously mocked the Cosmopolitan&nbsp;Magazine for the double standards regarding weight issues. She wrote: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-189 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;Do you think it's because I'm fat or not straight enough looking that I missed out on the cosmopolitan top 50?</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She is happy with how she looks and does not have any mindset of weight loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p><strong>See More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Laura Coates Bio Reveals!
