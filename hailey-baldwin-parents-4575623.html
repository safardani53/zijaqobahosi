Although Hailey later admitted she didn’t know much about Justin at the time of their first exchange, he later joined her and her parents for a family dinner and bowling outing after her dad “connected” with him and his mom as friends.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“To be honest, this is the truth. He was so new that I didn’t really know a lot about him yet,” she said during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “It was really kinda before anything. I met him and his mom and my dad kind of just connected as friends and we invited them over to our house the next day. So him and his mom just came over for family dinner with me and my family and we went bowling.”</p><h2><strong>Hailey Admitted She Turned To Her Parents First After Justin Proposed In 2018.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Hailey talked about how she asked for Stephen and Kennya’s advice after the “Baby” singer surprised her with a proposal shortly after they began dating. “In my heart I knew that’s what I wanted to do,” she said about saying “yes” to marrying Justin on his YouTube docuseries Justin Bieber: Seasons, but wanted to see if her parents would “stop” her “from doing something crazy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>After seeking them out, Hailey thought they would tell her to “relax and take a breath and think about this and see how you feel in like 24 hours or a week” but instead, they were fully supportive.

Since she’s reportedly a Democrat and and he was a <strong>Donald Trump</strong> supporter, it affected her in a not so great way. “That was a very hurtful situation for me,” she told the outlet. “I love my father, he’s an amazing dad, but we so strongly disagreed on [the election]. He and my sister strongly disagreed on it. My sister’s husband, like everyone on our side, just doesn’t agree with him. We don’t talk about it now.

I feel like if I didn’t have support, it would’ve been 10 times harder, and it was already the hardest thing in my life at the time.”</p><h2><strong>Hailey’s Mom Taught Her About ‘Clean Beauty.’</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hailey-baldwin-father-mom-kennya-mega-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>“My mother is Brazilian and I grew up in a house where she and my grandmother only used organic products, from hair dyes to cleaning products,” the blonde beauty said about Kennya, who is the daughter of legendary Brazilian composer <strong>Eumir Deodato</strong>, in an interview with Vogue. “I’ve been surrounded by natural and clean beauty my whole life.”</p><h2><strong>Hailey’s Expressed Her Gratitude For Her Parents On Social Media.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Once in a while, Hailey will dote on Stephen and Kennya in posts that honor holidays like Father’s or Mother’s Day and/or their birthdays. “<span>Happy Birthday Daddio.
