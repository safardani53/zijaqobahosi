She said no because she wanted to focus on her education, but in May 1946, he popped the question again and she said yes. Jimmy gifted Rosalynn a compact engraved with "ILYTG," an acronym for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Carter family's saying</a>, "I love you the goodest."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Now all our children do the same thing — ILYTG on the phone or in emails," Jimmy said.

"We developed a partnership when we were working in the farm supply business, and it continued when Jimmy got involved in politics," Rosalynn <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told the Associated Press</a>.
