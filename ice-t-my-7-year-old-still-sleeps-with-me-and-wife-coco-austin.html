Little is known about his eldest child’s mother, <strong>Adrienne</strong>, other than she was the rapper’s girlfriend at the time. He also shares son Tracy, 31, with his ex <strong>Darlene Ortiz</strong>.</p><p>The actor and Austin, 44, tied the knot in 2002. More than a decade later, the couple <a href=#>welcomed Chanel in November 2015</a>.</p><p>“I think the difference with Chanel and my other kids is I’m very conscious of this baby,” Ice-T explained on the podcast. “I had my [first] daughter when I was in high school. I was ripping and running, so it was presents over presence. I wasn’t there. My son … happened right when I was becoming Ice-T. You know, I’d never been famous before, this was a whole new thing, so I’m distracted by that [at the time]. Chanel, <a href=#>I’m comfortable.</a> I’m in a cruise pattern.”</p><p>The Equal Standard star said Chanel helped him “create new goals” in life despite having more than 20 seasons of <a href=#>SVU</a> and 10 albums under his belt. “You got that bread, you could start slowing down. But nah, not that new baby, and it’s the best gift I could ever get,” he said.</p><p>Earlier this year, Chanel stepped out with Austin to support her famous father at his Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony in Los Angeles. The trio posed for pictures in front of his Hollywood Boulevard star, with Chanel <a href=#>matching the musician</a>’s all-black attire in an adorable little black dress and shoes.</p><p>Since their daughter’s arrival, Ice-T and the Think Like a Man Too star have called out the parenting police several times. In July 2021, Austin responded to criticism over continuing to <a href=#>breast-feed Chanel</a>, who was then 5 years old. “Chanel still likes my boobs,” the model exclusively told Us Weekly at the time. “It’s a big bonding moment for a mother and your child.”</p><p>She continued: “Why take that away from her? … If she doesn’t want it, all right, that’s where you stop it. But I’m not going to say no.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later that year, the California native came under fire again for allowing her daughter to <a href=#>get acrylic nails</a> for her school picture day. Ice-T <a href=#>fired back at the trolls</a> during an October 2021 appearance on <a href=#>The View</a>, stating that his No. 1 rule is to “not pay attention to anything anyone says on the internet.”</p><p>The “Colors” singer noted that people should only be concerned with what others say to their faces. “The internet is the world. It’s the world talking, so I don’t pay attention,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaim5ViwW652GZuZrGVlr9uu8udZKysmaG5br%2FLnpypq12strW0jKacZpmemXq4tcWeZJynk6R6osHSraCnZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fice-t-my-7-year-old-still-sleeps-with-me-and-wife-coco-austin.html&text=Ice-T%3a%20My%207-Year-Old%20Still%20Sleeps%20With%20Me%20and%20Wife%20Coco%20Austin&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fice-t-my-7-year-old-still-sleeps-with-me-and-wife-coco-austin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fice-t-my-7-year-old-still-sleeps-with-me-and-wife-coco-austin.html&title=Ice-T%3a%20My%207-Year-Old%20Still%20Sleeps%20With%20Me%20and%20Wife%20Coco%20Austin" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fice-t-my-7-year-old-still-sleeps-with-me-and-wife-coco-austin.html&title=Ice-T%3a%20My%207-Year-Old%20Still%20Sleeps%20With%20Me%20and%20Wife%20Coco%20Austin" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fice-t-my-7-year-old-still-sleeps-with-me-and-wife-coco-austin.html&title=Ice-T%3a%20My%207-Year-Old%20Still%20Sleeps%20With%20Me%20and%20Wife%20Coco%20Austin" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fice-t-my-7-year-old-still-sleeps-with-me-and-wife-coco-austin.html&description=Ice-T%3a%20My%207-Year-Old%20Still%20Sleeps%20With%20Me%20and%20Wife%20Coco%20Austin" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jeffrey-jordans-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeffrey Jordans Girlfriend: Who is Jeffrey Jordan Dating?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./joe-madison.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Joe Madison net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
