Wexford in the Republic of Ireland and came to the UK in 2003.</p><p>Speaking before the same sex marriage referendum in 2015, Jen said she left Ireland because social attitudes meant she "never really felt she could be completely herself".</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Outlining why she moved to Scotland</a>, she said: “I gave myself a really hard time about being gay. It’s nothing something that was terribly openly discussed I think in general in Ireland at the time or seen as being acceptable.</p><p>“I needed to leave the country to go somewhere where I could not be looking over my shoulder worrying that somebody from my home town would spot me in a gay bar or with a partner.”</p><h2>When did they meet?</h2><p>The couple have been together since 2014, but in the early stages of the couple's relationship, Jen - a marketing assistant - kept a low profile until they appeared together in a Scottish Tory election broadcast in February 2015.</p><h2>Are they engaged?</h2><p>Ruth Davidson and Jen Wilson announced their engagement on May 23, 2016.</p><p>The 39-year-old party leader said they became engagement after she proposed to Jen while on holiday in Paris.</p><p>Ms Davidson posted a picture on Twitter and said: “So, I’ve been away for a few days as I had an important question to ask. Delighted Jen said yes. Very happy. X”</p><p>In a frank interview with the&nbsp;<a href=#>Sunday Times</a>, Davidson said she never wants to be Prime Minister.</p><p>She said she'd snub the top job for the sake of her mental health and relationship, as she opened up on her history of battling suicidal thoughts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000444664259.jpg><h2>When did Ruth give birth?</h2><p>On October 26&nbsp;,&nbsp;<a href=#>welcomed her 10lb arrival</a>&nbsp;at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.</p><p>"Welcome to the world, little one... Know you are loved," she tweeted.</p><p>She followed up with a witty joke and snap of her dog, wearing a scarf saying "big brother Wilson".</p><p>"Say what...?" she joked, zooming in on the dog's incredibly sad eyes after getting the news of the baby's arrival.</p><p>Announcing her pregnancy on April 26, Ruth said she and her partner since 2014 are "exited and daunted" about the months to come and are "over-joyed" at the prospect of starting a family together.</p><p>She said:&nbsp;"Jen and I are delighted to be able to say that we are starting a family. We weren't sure that it was going to happen for us, but we're really, really happy that it has."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN UK NEWS</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cta_banner_final3.jpg><p>She added: "Jen and I are incredibly lucky in the support we have received from our family and friends over the past few months - and we know we can rely on them in the months and years to come. I'd like to thank them all again today.</p><p>"We have always dreamed of starting a family and are pleased to be able to share our happy news."</p><p>The couple&nbsp;found out in March that an IVF procedure had been successful.</p><p>Ms Davidson, who says she has been affected by some morning sickness and fatigue during the early stages of her pregnancy, said it will be "business as usual" until she goes on maternity leave, and then her deputy within the party, Jackson Carlaw, will take her position for a few months.</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
