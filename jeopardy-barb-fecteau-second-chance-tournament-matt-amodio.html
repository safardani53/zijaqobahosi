It's about how you play the game.'"</p><p>But the student kept hounding her, as she relented: “Eventually I was like, 'Pete, I have some regrets!'"</p><p>“But he kept saying, 'They're gonna call you back, they're gonna call you back,' and he was right.</p><p>So thank you for believing in me, Pete!”</p><p>Ken was cracking up and replied: “Well, Matt is not here as a special guest, so I dont know if Pete will be happy, but you seemed relieved."&nbsp;</p><h2>BARB SCHOOLS HER OPPONENTS</h2><p>Going into Double Jeopardy!, Barb was at a round $0, Mark at $3,400, and Allison at $1,600.</p><p>She especially struggled with a category fittingly called “tricky questions.”</p><p>However, it wasn't a closed book for the librarian relentlessly pestered by her student Pete.</p><p>Just two clues into Double Jeopardy!, Barb recovered and found a Daily Double.</p><p>She did an "all in" motion a la <a href=#>James Holzhuaer</a> and jumped to the lead being correct on a $4000 Daily Double. “Let’s keep it going!” she declared.</p><p>Mark vied for the lead midway through the last Daily Double but missed it and could not recover.&nbsp;</p><p>Scores going into Final Jeopardy saw Barb in charge at $9,600, Mark at $2,800, and Allison at $6,400.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Jeopardy! under "MYTHOLOGY" read: "Chrysomallus was the name of the creature that was the source of this sought-after item, vellus aureum in Latin."</p><p>Everyone was correct with “Golden Fleece” and Barb added $3,201 to win with $12,801 as she pumped her fists in sheer joy.</p><h2>'GO BARB!'</h2><p>One fan wrote on <a href=#>Reddit</a>: “​​I liked Barb’s all-ins and how she got blessed with that book category with a Daily Double in it.</p><p>And her story about Pete and Matt Amodio was cute!"</p><p>Another ribbed: “I found it hilarious that Barb got the first clue in the tricky clues category and then proceeded to answer two other clues in the category with essentially the same response.”</p><p>A third wrote: "Love that 'All in' gesture. She does it very well."</p><p>A fourth wrote: "Barb should have eventually replied to that smart aleck Amodio fan kid with: 'what’s… report to the principal’s office.'"</p><p>Amodio most recently appeared on the first annual <a href=#>Jeopardy!
